### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to develop and organize educational materials for advanced mathematics and graph theory courses. This included creating course descriptions, associating exercises with classes, and correcting any errors in the material.

### Key Activities
- Described an advanced mathematics course focusing on challenging problems and high-level analytical skills.
- Developed coding schemes for different levels of mathematical rigor.
- Associated practical exercises with advanced mathematics classes, covering topics like differentiation, integration, and differential equations.
- Organized exercises for calculus practice sessions, including limits, derivatives, and integration.
- Assigned exercises to graph theory classes, ensuring coverage of topics like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Ford-Fulkerson algorithms.
- Corrected errors in information processing related to exercise lists.
- Implemented a basic graph structure in Python using adjacency lists.

### Achievements
- Comprehensive course descriptions and exercise associations were completed for both advanced mathematics and graph theory courses.
- Identified areas lacking content and planned for additional material development.
- Basic graph implementation in Python was successfully created, despite initial errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development of additional materials for areas identified as lacking.
- Continued refinement and testing of the Python graph implementation.

### Session Time
- **Start Time:** 21:30
- **End Time:** 22:20
