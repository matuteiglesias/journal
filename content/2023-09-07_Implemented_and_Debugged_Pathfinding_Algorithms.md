**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement and debug various pathfinding algorithms, focusing on depth-first search (DFS) and handling errors in the code.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed a practical work summary on algorithmic techniques, covering four exercises with specific problems.
- Developed conceptual solutions for programming exercises, focusing on search techniques, optimization, and balance adjustments.
- Implemented a DFS approach for the 'Sendero' problem, defining piece behaviors and movements.
- Encountered and addressed an error in the environment, continuing with implementation and testing.
- Corrected import statements in Python to fix an oversight with the `typing` module.
- Fixed a path length calculation error on a board, aiming to correct the function to consider minimum and maximum path lengths.
- Adjusted the DFS function to account for all possible piece rotations to find the shortest and longest paths.
- Provided a visual representation of the DFS solution for a puzzle, including complete Python code for implementation.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and debugged the DFS algorithm for pathfinding, ensuring it handles piece rotations and path lengths correctly.
- Provided visual representations of the solutions to enhance understanding and debugging.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the pathfinding algorithms to ensure robustness and efficiency.
- Explore additional pathfinding techniques for potential improvements.
