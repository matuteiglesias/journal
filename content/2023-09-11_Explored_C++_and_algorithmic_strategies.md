## üìÖ 2023-09-11 ‚Äî Session: Explored C++ and algorithmic strategies

**üïí 16:00‚Äì16:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: C++, algorithm, Python, brute force, dynamic programming  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and execute various programming and algorithmic strategies, focusing on C++ programming, error troubleshooting, and algorithm optimization techniques.

### Key Activities
- **C++ Programming**: Installed a C++ compiler and executed a C++ program across different operating systems. Resolved the 'undefined reference to main' error by identifying common causes and applying troubleshooting steps.
- **Algorithm Development**: Implemented a brute force algorithm in Python to minimize unhappiness by generating permutations. Conducted tests to compare discrepancies between greedy and brute force algorithms.
- **Algorithmic Strategies**: Discussed the trade-offs between brute force, greedy, and dynamic programming approaches, considering their efficiency and applicability.
- **Code Translation**: Translated Python code into C++ and provided instructions for compilation and execution.
- **Simulation**: Developed a Python script to simulate number sign influence on final sums, evaluating correctness against actual signs.

### Achievements
- Successfully executed C++ programs and resolved common errors.
- Developed and tested algorithms using brute force and greedy methods.
- Translated Python functions into C++ effectively.
- Simulated and validated algorithmic approaches for sum calculations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of dynamic programming strategies and their practical applications.
- Optimization of the brute force algorithm for better performance.
