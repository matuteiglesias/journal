## üìÖ 2023-09-11 ‚Äî Session: Refined Greedy Algorithm for Balance Adjustment

**üïí 16:30‚Äì16:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: greedy algorithm, balance adjustment, function redefinition, algorithm comparison  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to improve the greedy algorithm approach for adjusting numerical balances, exploring its limitations and potential alternatives.

### Key Activities:
- **Reflection on Greedy Algorithm Limitations:** Discussed the challenges of using a greedy algorithm in numerical problems, particularly its inability to handle differences effectively.
- **Algorithm Improvement Proposal:** Suggested a method to track differences more precisely and considered the practicality of a brute force approach.
- **Execution and Debugging:** Re-executed the `saldos_sospechosos_mejorado` function due to an execution environment error.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Compared outputs between the greedy and brute force approaches, highlighting discrepancies.
- **Function Redefinition:** Planned to redefine `saldos_sospechosos` and `brute_force_saldos` functions for further comparison.

### Achievements:
- Identified the limitations of the greedy approach and proposed a refined method for balance adjustment.
- Highlighted the need for redefining functions to ensure accurate comparisons.

### Pending Tasks:
- Redefine the functions `saldos_sospechosos` and `brute_force_saldos` for thorough comparison in future sessions.
