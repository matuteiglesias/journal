## üìÖ 2023-09-12 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Graph Data Visualization Techniques

**üïí 17:10‚Äì17:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Graph Theory, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the visualization of graph data by employing various Python libraries to display and compare graph method performances effectively.

### Key Activities
- **Displaying Winners Table**: Developed Python code using pandas to style and highlight winning methods in tables for sparse and dense graphs.
- **Performance Visualization**: Created side-by-side plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to compare graph method performances on different graph types.
- **Plot Modifications**: Modified plot characteristics in Seaborn, including plot size, grid style, and label translations.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Conducted a theoretical and practical analysis of vertex removal time complexity in different graph data structures.
- **LaTeX Formatting in Plots**: Implemented LaTeX-style formatting in Matplotlib for better handling of special characters.

### Achievements
- Successfully generated styled tables and comparative plots for graph data.
- Enhanced plot aesthetics and clarity through customization.
- Gained insights into time complexity for vertex removal in graphs.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of graph method optimizations and their impact on visualization.
- Review and refine LaTeX formatting for broader use cases.
