## üìÖ 2023-09-20 ‚Äî Session: Optimized Store Placement and Distance Calculation

**üïí 18:30‚Äì19:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, algorithm, error correction, store placement, distance calculation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to correct and optimize functions related to store placement and distance calculation in a Python algorithm.

### Key Activities
- Identified and corrected errors in the `costo_minimo_desde_` and `calcular_distancia_acumulada` functions to ensure accurate distance calculations.
- Implemented recursive logic to minimize costs, using the `min()` function effectively.
- Analyzed and optimized an algorithm for store placement, addressing errors in cost evaluation and proposing solutions.
- Resolved multiple `IndexError` and `ValueError` issues by adjusting list indexing and function arguments.
- Addressed execution environment issues by redefining necessary variables and functions.

### Achievements
- Successfully corrected the distance calculation logic, ensuring the algorithm accurately evaluates store placement and costs.
- Improved error handling and debugging processes for Python functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Execute the modified code locally to verify the correctness of the solutions implemented.
