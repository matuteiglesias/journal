## 📅 2023-09-28 — Session: Developed and Tested Data Aggregation Pipeline

**🕒 16:00–16:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data aggregation, Python, pandas, data processing, CSV export  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop and test a data aggregation pipeline for multiple datasets, focusing on money-related columns and addressing common data processing issues.

### Key Activities
- **Data Aggregation Plan**: Outlined a structured plan for aggregating datasets by characteristics and year, focusing on money-related columns.
- **Key Columns Identification**: Identified key columns for datasets `df_wb`, `df_aiddata_china`, and `df_aiddata_wb` for further aggregation.
- **Python Function Development**: Developed Python functions for data aggregation using pandas, resolving common DataFrame issues such as `SettingWithCopyWarning` and aggregation duplication.
- **Loop and Data Inspection**: Implemented a loop to print money column values for data inspection, and addressed execution in a local environment for better inspection.
- **Data Cleaning**: Parsed numeric columns and handled duplicate entries in DataFrames, ensuring proper data formatting and aggregation.
- **Datetime and CSV Export**: Ensured consistent datetime formatting and exported aggregated data to CSV files.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and tested a comprehensive data aggregation pipeline using Python and pandas.
- Resolved common issues related to DataFrame manipulation and aggregation.
- Prepared cross-section datasets for review by Eric and Raolin.

### Pending Tasks
- Await feedback from Eric and Raolin on the prepared datasets to make any necessary modifications.
