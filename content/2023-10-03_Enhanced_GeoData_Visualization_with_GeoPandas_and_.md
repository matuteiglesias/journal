## 📅 2023-10-03 — Session: Enhanced GeoData Visualization with GeoPandas and Matplotlib

**🕒 16:50–17:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization, Python, Geospatial  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the visualization of geospatial data using Python libraries GeoPandas and Matplotlib, focusing on refining aesthetics and functionality.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a Python script to plot GeoJSON data using GeoPandas, integrating it with additional datasets and visualizing it with Matplotlib.
- Updated the plotting code to include aesthetic improvements, such as color mapping and hatch patterns, ensuring clarity and visual appeal.
- Refactored the GeoDataFrame plotting process to optimize performance and simplify the code structure.
- Adjusted color mappings and hatch patterns in the visualization to ensure accurate representation of data.
- Improved the visualization by adding titles, legends, and utilizing hatch patterns for overlapping features.
- Fixed issues with hatch patterns in Matplotlib legends by using custom legend items.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created enhanced geospatial data visualizations with refined aesthetics and improved performance.
- Resolved issues related to hatch patterns and color mappings, ensuring the visual clarity of the data.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the plotting logic with diverse datasets to ensure robustness across different scenarios.
- Exploration of additional aesthetic features and customizations in Matplotlib and GeoPandas.
