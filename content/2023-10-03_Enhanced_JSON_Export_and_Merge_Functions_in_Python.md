**üïí 21:45‚Äì22:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, JSON, Data Processing, Time Series, Debugging  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance and redesign JSON export and merge functions for handling hierarchical data structures in Python, particularly focusing on time series data.

### Key Activities
- **Design Approaches for Data Structuring:** Explored four methods for structuring data related to poverty metrics, discussing their pros and cons.
- **Data Access for Time Series:** Implemented Python code snippets to extract time series data from JSON structures.
- **Redesign of JSON Export Functions:** Redesigned `exportar_a_json_jerarquico` and `merge_jsons` functions to create hierarchical JSON structures.
- **Incorporating Metadata:** Updated the `exportar_a_json_jerarquico` function to include metadata fields such as `last_updated`, `frecuencia`, and `frac`.
- **Hierarchical JSON Structure Function:** Developed a function to convert a DataFrame into a hierarchical JSON structure.
- **Fixing Data Overwrite Issues:** Revised the `merge_jsons` function to prevent data overwriting during JSON merging.
- **Verbose Logging:** Added print statements to the `merge_jsons` function for enhanced debugging.

### Achievements
- Successfully redesigned and implemented enhanced JSON export and merge functions.
- Improved data handling by incorporating metadata and fixing data overwrite issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced functions to ensure robustness in diverse data scenarios.
- Explore additional logging mechanisms for better traceability.
