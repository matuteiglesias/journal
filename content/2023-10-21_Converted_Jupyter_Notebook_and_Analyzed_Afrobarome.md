## 📅 2023-10-21 — Session: Converted Jupyter Notebook and Analyzed Afrobarometer Data

**🕒 21:40–22:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Jupyter, HTML Conversion, Afrobarometer, Data Analysis, Visualization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to convert a Jupyter notebook into an HTML format and to analyze Afrobarometer data for insights and visualization.

### Key Activities
- **Jupyter Notebook Conversion**: Utilized `jupyter nbconvert` to convert a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) to an HTML file. This involved resolving compatibility issues between the `jinja2` library and `nbconvert` tool.
- **Afrobarometer Data Analysis**: Created markdown descriptions for Afrobarometer maps and provided an overview of the variables and datasets. An email update was sent to Eric detailing the available datasets and visualizations.

### Achievements
- Successfully converted the Jupyter notebook '60 - Afrob. Exploration.ipynb' to HTML, addressing syntax highlighting and accessibility warnings.
- Compiled and communicated a summary of Afrobarometer variables and datasets, enhancing understanding of geospatial distribution and data insights.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration and refinement of Afrobarometer data visualizations may be needed for deeper insights.
