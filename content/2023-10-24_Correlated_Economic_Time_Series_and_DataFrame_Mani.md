## üìÖ 2023-10-24 ‚Äî Session: Correlated Economic Time Series and DataFrame Manipulation

**üïí 00:20‚Äì02:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: DataFrame Manipulation, Time Series Analysis, Economic Correlation, Python Programming  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze correlations between economic time series, specifically focusing on the relationship between the BCRA's international reserves and national law public securities, and to manipulate DataFrames for data analysis and visualization.

### Key Activities
- **Economic Analysis**: Reflected on the negative correlation between BCRA's reserves and public securities, suggesting deeper analysis.
- **DataFrame Manipulation**: Provided instructions for selecting columns using `serie_id` and defining the `equivalent_series` DataFrame.
- **Function Definition**: Proposed defining the `find_equivalent_series` function for further data manipulation.
- **Troubleshooting**: Addressed missing DataFrames and undefined variables, offering solutions for context restoration and variable redefinition.
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced plot aesthetics using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and generated plots for financial variables.
- **Time Series Alignment**: Developed methods for aligning time series data with different units using resampling and proportionality factors.

### Achievements
- Clarified the correlation between economic indicators.
- Provided comprehensive guides and code snippets for DataFrame manipulation and visualization.
- Developed strategies for handling MultiIndex DataFrames and aligning time series data.

### Pending Tasks
- Define the `find_equivalent_series` function based on previous discussions.
- Upload or generate necessary DataFrames (`data_m`, `consultas`, `serie`) for analysis.
- Continue deeper analysis on the economic correlation insights identified.
