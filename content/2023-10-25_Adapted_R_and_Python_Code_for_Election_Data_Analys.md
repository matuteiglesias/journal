**üïí 14:25‚Äì15:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: R Programming, Python, Data Analysis, Optimization, Debugging  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to adapt and implement code for analyzing election data using both R and Python, focusing on creating pivot tables, processing data, and applying statistical models.

### Key Activities
- Adapted R code for analyzing election data structured in pivot tables, including creating necessary matrices and interpreting results.
- Provided a step-by-step guide for converting Pandas DataFrames to NumPy matrices and implementing optimization functions in Python.
- Implemented the penalized least squares criterion using Python, highlighting differences in indexing and matrix handling between R and Python.
- Utilized Scipy's `minimize` function for optimization and created a placeholder for the `call_difp` function.
- Debugged slicing errors and input issues in Python functions, adding debug print statements for troubleshooting.
- Explained how to add new columns to data frames in both R and Python, and how to normalize voting data using proportions.

### Achievements
- Successfully adapted R code for election data analysis and implemented equivalent Python code for data processing and optimization.
- Debugged and improved Python functions for calculating penalized least squares and handling input errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the adapted Python code to ensure accuracy and efficiency in data analysis.
- Exploration of additional optimization techniques and their impact on the analysis results.
