## 📅 2023-10-25 — Session: Debugged and optimized Python functions for data analysis

**🕒 15:25–16:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Optimization, Debugging, DataFrames, NumPy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Python functions used in data analysis and optimization tasks.

### Key Activities
- Merged two pandas DataFrames, `mesas` and `dsGpre`, ensuring proper alignment by resetting indices and specifying merge keys.
- Debugged the `params_estim` and `call_difp` functions to address dimension mismatches and optimize performance, adding print statements for better diagnostics.
- Adjusted the `parSeed` parameter using an identity matrix in NumPy, ensuring correct initialization for optimization problems.
- Modified a function to include data sampling capabilities, enhancing flexibility in handling large datasets.
- Conducted a code review and updated parameter estimation functions with detailed comments and testing examples.

### Achievements
- Successfully merged DataFrames and debugged key functions, improving their reliability and performance.
- Enhanced the initialization of optimization parameters, ensuring compatibility with model requirements.
- Improved code clarity and functionality through a comprehensive code review.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the modified functions with larger datasets to ensure scalability and robustness.
- Explore additional optimization techniques to enhance performance further.
