**🕒 03:40–04:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data_analysis, visualization, Python, matplotlib, voter_behavior  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to review and enhance code for processing and merging datasets to analyze voter behavior and income data, and to create visualizations for electoral analysis.

### Key Activities:
- Reviewed a code snippet for merging datasets related to income and voter behavior, suggesting best practices for improvement.
- Outlined steps to merge `circuitos` and `data_circ` datasets, sort by elector count, apply binning, and create visualizations.
- Requested the upload of necessary datasets for analysis.
- Provided a structured workflow for merging and analyzing electoral circuit datasets, including data processing and visualization steps.
- Adapted Python code for visualizing political data using box plots and scatter plots, focusing on clarity and efficiency.
- Modified plot aesthetics in Matplotlib to enhance visual appeal, addressing a font size parameter error.

### Achievements:
- Established a comprehensive workflow for dataset merging and visualization.
- Improved the clarity and functionality of data visualization code.
- Resolved a Matplotlib font size parameter error, enhancing plot aesthetics.

### Pending Tasks:
- Upload the `circuitos` and `data_circ` datasets to proceed with the outlined data merging and visualization tasks.
