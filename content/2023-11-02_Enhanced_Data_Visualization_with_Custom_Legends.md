## 📅 2023-11-02 — Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Custom Legends

**🕒 22:55–23:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: matplotlib, data visualization, custom legends, error handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective was to enhance data visualization by creating custom legends for plots using matplotlib, ensuring clarity between different data series.

### Key Activities
- Developed a custom legend to differentiate between 'Agglomerados avg' and 'No Agglomerados avg' using distinct colors and markers.
- Addressed a KeyError in the `style_dict` by substituting an undefined color reference with a hex code for orange.
- Provided a code snippet for integrating custom legend handles into existing plot code, ensuring clear visual distinction between data series.
- Updated plotting logic to improve data visualization, focusing on color assignments, yearly averages, scatter plots, and moving averages.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and integrated custom legends into plots, enhancing the clarity and readability of visual data representations.
- Resolved the KeyError issue, ensuring robust and error-free plotting code.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated plotting logic in different scenarios to ensure consistent performance and visualization quality.
