## üìÖ 2023-11-11 ‚Äî Session: Developed Text Cleaning and Data Processing Functions

**üïí 03:00‚Äì04:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Text Processing, Data Cleaning, Semantic Analysis, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop and refine Python functions for text cleaning, data processing, and semantic analysis, focusing on error correction, formatting, and data manipulation.

### Key Activities:
- Implemented a Python function to merge invalid sections of text into previous valid sections, enhancing data integrity.
- Utilized `random.sample` for random sampling from lists of tuples, addressing common errors with `np.random.choice`.
- Outlined a structured approach for semantic analysis, including data preparation and tool selection.
- Developed Python rules for fixing parsing errors using `str.replace()` and regular expressions.
- Designed functions for text formatting and cleaning, addressing punctuation, spacing, and typographical errors.
- Applied text cleaning functions to merged sections and regenerated lost data sections due to disconnection.
- Converted cleaned tuples into Pandas DataFrames for structured data manipulation.
- Counted word frequencies in Spanish text using NLTK, excluding stopwords.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented and tested multiple text processing and cleaning functions.
- Enhanced data processing workflows by integrating semantic analysis and data manipulation techniques.
- Converted processed text into structured DataFrames, facilitating further analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Re-upload original text data to regenerate lost merged sections.
- Further testing and validation of text cleaning functions on larger datasets.
