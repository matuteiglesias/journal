## 📅 2023-11-11 — Session: Enhanced Python Regex Section Parsing Script

**🕒 01:15–02:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Regex, Text Parsing, Error Handling, Data Structures  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to improve a Python script for parsing hierarchical section enumerators from structured text files using regular expressions.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a Python script utilizing regular expressions to parse sections from text files and store them in a dictionary.
- Modified the script to handle multiple entries with the same section number using a list of tuples.
- Revised the regular expression to ensure proper text capture following section numbers, addressing issues with text extraction.
- Implemented a refined regex pattern to capture section headers, ensuring compliance with numerical format rules.
- Applied a fixer transformation to validate section numbers and sequence, integrating it with text parsing for streamlined processing.
- Addressed a ValueError in the parsing function by adjusting the logic for handling section separations.
- Tested the improved functions with a larger sample document to ensure accuracy and correct structure.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully enhanced the section parsing script to handle complex scenarios, including multiple entries and validation of section numbers.
- Improved the script's reliability and accuracy in extracting and organizing section data from text files.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing with diverse document samples to ensure robustness across different text structures.
