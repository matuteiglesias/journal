## 📅 2023-11-11 — Session: Enhanced section number validation with regex update

**🕒 02:40–02:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, regex, validation, debugging, section numbers  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The session aimed to improve the validation of section numbers within a document by refining the logic and correcting errors in the existing code.

**Key Activities**:
- Developed a Python function to determine valid precedents for section numbers.
- Identified and corrected a mistake in the function call for `is_valid_continuation`, ensuring it accepts individual section numbers.
- Addressed an error related to an undefined function `is_valid_precedent` by suggesting its definition.
- Updated the regex pattern to accurately parse section numbers by ensuring word boundaries, resolving issues with misidentification in larger numeric sequences.

**Achievements**:
- Successfully implemented a regex pattern that correctly identifies section numbers like '3.8' and '3.8.1'.
- Clarified and corrected function calls and definitions to enhance the validation process.

**Pending Tasks**:
- Define the `is_valid_precedent` function to complete the functionality for section number validation.
- Further test the updated regex pattern across diverse document structures to ensure robustness.
