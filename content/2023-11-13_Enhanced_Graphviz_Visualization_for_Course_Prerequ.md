**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the visualization of course prerequisites using Graphviz, focusing on improving layout, styling, and output formats.

**Key Activities:**
- Identified and planned to fix errors in graph generation.
- Reviewed guidelines for creating course prerequisite graphs with Graphviz, covering installation, data preparation, and visualization.
- Modified Graphviz code to create a subgraph for CBC courses, addressing rendering limitations.
- Adjusted graphs to treat CBC subgraph as a single node linked to 'E. Media'.
- Fixed CBC subgraph representation with invisible edges.
- Improved graph layout using invisible anchors and node repositioning.
- Discussed image analysis capabilities and extracted text from images related to educational content.
- Arranged graphs to fit an A4 layout using invisible edges and ranking constraints.
- Explored node placement workarounds and controlled node positioning using invisible nodes and edges.
- Modified subgraph appearance by changing background colors and borders.
- Utilized layers for complex visualizations, addressing limitations in non-PostScript formats.
- Reviewed output format options for Graphviz, including PNG, SVG, and PostScript.

**Achievements:**
- Developed a comprehensive approach to enhance Graphviz visualizations for course prerequisites.
- Implemented code adjustments to improve graph layout and styling.
- Explored alternative methods for layering and output formats.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further explore and implement alternative methods for achieving desired graph layouts, particularly in non-PostScript formats.
- Continue testing and refining the visualization techniques for broader application.
