### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine algorithms for optimizing urban bus routes using graph theory, specifically focusing on Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Key Activities
- Proposed a framework for simplifying bus lines by utilizing shortest path algorithms and evaluating route efficiency.
- Designed an exercise involving Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize bus routes in a city modeled as a grid.
- Developed Python functions: `cm(recorrido, grid)` for calculating the shortest path and `eliminar(recorrido, paradas)` for optimizing routes by removing stops.
- Presented pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm, formatted in the style of Cormen's book.
- Outlined a problem statement for optimizing bus routes in the fictional city of Optimoville.

### Achievements
- Established a clear framework and set of functions for optimizing bus routes using graph algorithms.
- Provided educational materials and pseudocode to facilitate understanding and implementation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the developed algorithms in practical scenarios.
- Exploration of additional optimization techniques to enhance route efficiency.
