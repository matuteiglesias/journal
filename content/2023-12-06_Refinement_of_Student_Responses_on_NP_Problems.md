### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine and transcribe student responses related to NP problems and algorithm complexity into LaTeX format, ensuring clarity and correctness.

### Key Activities
- Transcribed and corrected Student 99's response, focusing on disconnected sets in graph theory and their relation to NP problems.
- Restored Student 108's response, addressing NP problems and algorithms, and ensuring proper mathematical notation in LaTeX.
- Guided Student 107 on transforming DOMINATING-SET to DISCO-DOM, emphasizing the NP-hardness proof.
- Enhanced explanations of k-DISCO-DOM's polynomial complexity for Student 107.
- Evaluated responses on algorithm complexity and clarity, particularly for Students 141 and 135, suggesting improvements in their demonstrations.

### Achievements
- Successfully transcribed and corrected student responses into LaTeX, enhancing their clarity and technical accuracy.
- Provided detailed guidance on NP-hardness and polynomial complexity, improving the quality of student demonstrations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of Student 141's response to ensure depth and clarity in algorithm explanations.
- Additional guidance for Student 135 to strengthen their demonstration on DISCO-DOM and k-DISCO-DOM.
