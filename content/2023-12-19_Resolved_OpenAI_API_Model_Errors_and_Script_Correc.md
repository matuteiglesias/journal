### Session Goal
The session aimed to address and resolve issues related to OpenAI API model errors and to implement necessary corrections in Python scripts for proper API integration.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed the essential steps for accessing and using the ChatGPT API, including setting up the development environment and handling API responses.
- Troubleshot and resolved errors related to the non-existence of specified ChatGPT models by checking model names and verifying API plan compatibility.
- Provided guidance on resolving 'invalid model ID' errors in OpenAI API requests, including code examples for correct usage.
- Retrieved a list of available models from OpenAI's API using a Python script, ensuring proper response handling and security.
- Corrected the Python script to fix issues with the model variable formatting in the URL string.
- Modified the script to use the correct API endpoint for GPT-4, transitioning from `v1/completions` to `v1/chat/completions`.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved model errors in OpenAI API requests and corrected Python scripts for accurate API integration.
- Enhanced understanding of API usage and error handling with practical code examples.

### Pending Tasks
- Explore innovative applications of OpenAI GPT and language models with a focus on ethical considerations.
