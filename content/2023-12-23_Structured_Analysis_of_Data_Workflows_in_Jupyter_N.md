## üìÖ 2023-12-23 ‚Äî Session: Structured Analysis of Data Workflows in Jupyter Notebooks

**üïí 15:40‚Äì16:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Jupyter notebooks, data analysis, workflow, file management, Bash commands  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to analyze and enhance the understanding of data workflows within Jupyter notebooks, focusing on empirical analysis and file management.

### Key Activities:
- **Empirical Data Analysis**: Reviewed the use of 'empirical' in Jupyter notebooks to understand its significance in statistical analysis and visualization.
- **Bash Command Utilization**: Explored the `ls -l` command for detailed file information and sorted files by modification time to analyze work patterns.
- **File Modification Analysis**: Conducted an analysis of work eras based on file modification times, identifying shifts in research focus.
- **Directory Structuring**: Proposed a structured directory organization for project files to enhance manageability.
- **Jupyter Notebook Workflow**: Used `grep` commands to analyze data workflows, excluding checkpoint files for cleaner results.
- **Data Processing Workflow**: Outlined high-level workflows for data processing in Python notebooks, including data import, analysis, and export.
- **Data Export Methods**: Summarized common data export and plot saving methods in Jupyter notebooks.
- **Proposed Workflow Structure**: Suggested a general workflow structure for data projects using Graphviz dot language.
- **Notebook Management**: Developed efficient prompts for summarizing Jupyter notebook content.

### Achievements:
- Enhanced understanding of empirical data workflows and file management practices.
- Developed a structured directory plan and workflow structure for data projects.

### Pending Tasks:
- Implement the proposed directory structure and workflow in ongoing projects.
- Further refine the prompts for notebook analysis to improve clarity and efficiency.
