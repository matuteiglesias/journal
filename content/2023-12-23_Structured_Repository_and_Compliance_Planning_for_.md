## üìÖ 2023-12-23 ‚Äî Session: Structured Repository and Compliance Planning for Data Projects

**üïí 18:30‚Äì20:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: repository, documentation, compliance, Jupyter, Matplotlib  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to establish a structured plan for organizing data analysis repositories and ensuring compliance with research guidelines.

### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive plan for structuring a data analysis repository, focusing on documentation, data provenance, licensing, and organization to enhance clarity and reproducibility.
- Outlined a project plan to ensure adherence to American Economic Association (AEA) guidelines, emphasizing best practices in data and code sharing, documentation, ethics, and maintenance.
- Analyzed a Jupyter notebook for statistical analysis, identifying optimization opportunities and potential bottlenecks, and provided recommendations for improvement.
- Fixed an `AttributeError` in Matplotlib's histogram function by replacing the deprecated `normed` parameter with `density` for compatibility with newer versions.
- Defined the requirements for analyzing economic data, particularly cross-covariance terms, to understand sectoral sales dynamics.

### Achievements
- Established clear guidelines for repository structuring and research compliance.
- Resolved a coding error in data visualization, improving compatibility with updated libraries.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the recommended optimizations in the Jupyter notebook to enhance performance.
- Further develop the economic data analysis plan, focusing on statistical methods for cross-covariance analysis.
