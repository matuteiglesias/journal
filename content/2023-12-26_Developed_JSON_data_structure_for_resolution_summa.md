## 📅 2023-12-26 — Session: Developed JSON data structure for resolution summaries

**🕒 22:00–22:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: JSON, API, Python, Data Extraction, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The session aimed to develop a structured approach for summarizing resolutions, facilitating data analysis and filtering.

**Key Activities**:
1. **Structured Summary Template**: Created a data structure template to organize resolution summaries, detailing actions and objects involved.
2. **Standard JSON Prompt**: Developed a standardized prompt for automating JSON data structure generation, including API usage instructions.
3. **Python Code for Extraction**: Implemented Python code to extract resolutions and dispositions from summaries, organizing them with date and text.
4. **Code Correction**: Corrected the Python code to prevent overwriting of 'date' and 'summary' by using a list of dictionaries.
5. **API Prompt for Data Extraction**: Crafted a prompt for API to analyze summaries and extract key actions and objects, ensuring a coherent data structure.

**Achievements**: Successfully created templates and code for organizing and extracting data from resolution summaries, with a corrected data structure approach.

**Pending Tasks**: Further testing and validation of the API prompts and Python code to ensure robust data extraction and organization.
