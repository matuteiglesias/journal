**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve error handling in API calls for legislative document processing and automate the creation of a consolidated Markdown document.

### Key Activities
- **Error Handling:** Addressed a '502 Bad Gateway' error in OpenAI API calls by implementing a robust Python loop that ensures continued processing despite temporary file issues.
- **API Response Management:** Improved the handling of API responses by resetting the `api_responses` variable at the start of each loop iteration to prevent accumulation in Markdown files.
- **Markdown Automation:** Developed a Python script to consolidate multiple Markdown files into a single document, ensuring proper order and separation.
- **Web Scraping Enhancements:** Utilized BeautifulSoup to extract titles and subtitles from HTML, focusing on `<h3>` tags and Roman numerals.
- **Legal Document Integration:** Proposed methods to integrate section headers into legal documents without disrupting logical order.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented error handling for API calls.
- Automated the consolidation of Markdown documents.
- Enhanced web scraping techniques for extracting structured data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the Markdown consolidation script in diverse scenarios.
- Optimization of the web scraping functions for different HTML structures.
