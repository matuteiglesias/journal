## üìÖ 2024-01-15 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Processing and Visualization Techniques

**üïí 18:10‚Äì18:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: data processing, visualization, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance data processing functions for financial tickers and improve data visualization techniques using Python libraries.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a streamlined function for processing stock data, which includes fetching and enhancing data with additional columns for residuals and returns.
- Explored combining line plots and candlestick charts using Matplotlib and mplfinance, providing insights on setting up twin axes for better visualization.
- Addressed the `SettingWithCopyWarning` in Pandas, offering solutions to avoid it by using `.copy()` and `.loc[]` methods.
- Improved practices for DataFrame modifications in Pandas to ensure stable behavior and prevent warnings.
- Resolved issues with Unix timestamp handling in date visualizations, ensuring proper parsing to datetime objects.
- Enhanced the readability of date labels on Matplotlib x-axis by customizing date formats and label rotations.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully designed a comprehensive data processing function for stock data.
- Developed clear guidelines for combining different chart types in data visualization.
- Implemented best practices for DataFrame manipulation to avoid common warnings.
- Improved date handling and display in visualizations, enhancing clarity and accuracy.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the new data processing function in different scenarios.
- Exploration of additional visualization libraries for more complex data representations.
