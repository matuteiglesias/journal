## 📅 2024-01-16 — Session: Debugged and Enhanced OLSResiduals Indicator in Backtrader

**🕒 14:55–15:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Backtrader, OLSResiduals, Python, Debugging, Trading Strategy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to integrate and debug the OLSResiduals indicator within a multi-stock trading strategy using Backtrader.

### Key Activities
- Developed a guide for integrating OLS residuals into a trading strategy, focusing on custom indicator creation and strategy logic modification.
- Addressed a TypeError in the OLSResiduals initialization by modifying the class definition and removing unnecessary arguments.
- Resolved a ValueError related to zero-size arrays by ensuring sufficient data points for OLS fitting and implementing error handling.
- Implemented debugging techniques to diagnose issues with empty price arrays and refined data fetching methods within the OLSResiduals class.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated the OLSResiduals indicator into Backtrader with enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities.
- Improved data fetching and initialization processes to prevent common errors related to empty arrays.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing is required to validate the robustness of the new implementation under various market conditions.
- Additional documentation and comments should be added to the code for clarity and future reference.
