### Session Goal
The session focused on enhancing a trading strategy using the Backtrader framework, aiming to improve data processing, visualization, and strategy execution.

### Key Activities
- **Procedures for CNH Renewal**: Reviewed the steps for renewing a driver's license in Palho√ßa, SC, including required documents and scheduling.
- **Investment Strategy Evaluation**: Outlined a proposed investment strategy combining technical analysis and systematic trading rules.
- **Data Processing Enhancements**: Expanded Python code to include weekly data resampling using the yfinance library.
- **Model Fitting Techniques**: Discussed exponential model fitting for stock analysis and implemented a linear fit on log-transformed stock prices.
- **Data Visualization Optimization**: Optimized plotting of indicators in data visualizations to avoid redundancy.
- **Backtrader Strategy Implementation**: Modified the `OLSResiduals` indicator, adjusted the `plotinfo` attribute, and implemented trading logic using the `next` method.

### Achievements
