## 📅 2024-01-16 — Session: Resolved Plot Display Issues in Python with Matplotlib

**🕒 17:20–17:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Matplotlib, Backtrader, Plotting, Troubleshooting  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to displaying and saving plots in Python, specifically using Matplotlib within the Backtrader framework.

### Key Activities
- **Troubleshooting Plot Display**: Addressed issues with plot display in interactive Python environments, including configuration checks and explicit plot saving.
- **Handling Unexpected Outputs**: Modified code to handle unexpected outputs from `cerebro.plot()`, ensuring proper saving of figures.
- **Code Refinement**: Updated Python code to save Matplotlib figures from a nested list structure with unique filenames.
- **Resolving Time Series Issues**: Focused on plotting `OLSResiduals` indicator only once and identified missing cash and total investment line plots.
- **Configuring Data Feeds**: Managed multiple data feed instances in Backtrader, focusing on plotting cash and total investment.
- **Customizing Plotting**: Customized plotting for Broker and Trades observers in the Cerebro framework.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved plotting issues in Matplotlib within the Backtrader context.
- Enhanced code to correctly save figures with unique filenames.
- Improved configuration for data feeds and plotting observers in Backtrader.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the refined code in various interactive environments to ensure robustness.
