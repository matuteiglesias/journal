## 📅 2024-01-18 — Session: Debugged data feed issues in Backtrader strategies

**🕒 20:30–21:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Backtrader, Debugging, Data Feeds, Python, Cerebro  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve data feed issues in Backtrader strategies, specifically focusing on the Cerebro framework and the `ResidualsCSVData` class.

### Key Activities:
- **Troubleshooting Data Access**: Explored methods to resolve data access issues within a Cerebro strategy, focusing on correct data referencing and indexing.
- **Minimal Backtrader Strategy**: Developed a minimal strategy to test and debug residual data loading and access.
- **Expanded Diagnostics**: Implemented detailed diagnostics in the `TestResidualsStrategy` class to identify data feed issues.
- **Debugging Techniques**: Applied systematic approaches to debug data reading issues, including checking data integrity and modifying CSV readers.
- **Understanding ResidualsCSVData**: Clarified the structure and usage of the `ResidualsCSVData` class, focusing on its integration with financial data analysis.
- **Zero-Length Data Feeds**: Investigated and addressed zero-length data feed issues, focusing on CSV content and data loading methods.

### Achievements:
- Successfully identified and resolved several data feed issues in Backtrader strategies, enhancing data accessibility and integrity.
- Improved understanding of the `ResidualsCSVData` class and its application in financial data analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of modified strategies to ensure robustness across different datasets.
- Continued refinement of debugging techniques for complex data feed scenarios.
