## 📅 2024-01-18 — Session: Integrated OLS Residuals into Backtrader Strategies

**🕒 13:10–14:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Backtrader, OLS, Residuals, Python, Algorithmic Trading  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to integrate residuals from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression into Backtrader strategies for enhanced decision-making in algorithmic trading.

### Key Activities:
- **Data Preparation**: Calculated rolling OLS residuals using Python, Pandas, and Statsmodels for stock price data.
- **Optimization**: Implemented performance optimization by calculating residuals with selected data points to speed up computation.
- **Strategy Implementation**: Modified Backtrader strategies to incorporate residual data feeds, adjusting parameters for trading decisions based on calculated residuals.

### Achievements:
- Successfully calculated and integrated OLS residuals into Backtrader strategies.
- Optimized the residual calculation process for efficiency.
- Enhanced trading strategy by incorporating residuals into buy/sell decision processes.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of the strategy in live trading environments to ensure robustness and accuracy of decision-making.
- Explore additional optimization techniques for residual calculation.
