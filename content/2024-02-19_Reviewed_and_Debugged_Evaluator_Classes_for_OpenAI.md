### Session Goal
The session aimed to review and debug the Evaluator classes used with the OpenAI API, focusing on ensuring proper functionality, extensibility, and error handling.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a detailed code review of the Evaluator classes, identifying necessary corrections and improvements.
- Debugged an API error in the Evaluator40 class related to a null value in the 'content' field, providing a step-by-step troubleshooting guide.
- Reviewed the implementation of `exercise_content` in Evaluator35 and Evaluator40 classes, suggesting logging and verification steps to diagnose content handling issues.
- Proposed improvements in data diagnosis and management by implementing checks and logs in the `construct_prompt` function and `evaluate` calls.
- Addressed conceptual and technical issues in the Evaluator35 class, recommending making the Evaluator class an abstract base class for better structure and validation.
- Enhanced debugging techniques in Python by adding logging statements to track execution flow and capture errors.
- Resolved code inconsistency in handling `exercise_id` and `filename` in the `get_exercise_content` function.

### Achievements
- Improved code structure and error handling in the Evaluator classes.
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with systematic logging and verification.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the Evaluator classes after implementing suggested changes to ensure robustness and reliability.
