**üïí 18:25‚Äì19:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flask, API, Machine Learning, Python, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to set up a Flask API to serve predictions from a machine learning model, ensuring the application is well-structured and tested.

### Key Activities
- **Setting Up Flask API**: Implemented a Flask API to handle model predictions, including setup and code implementation.
- **Organizing Application Structure**: Defined a structured approach for the Flask application with separate files for API routes and the main entry point.
- **Centralizing Prediction Logic**: Centralized prediction logic to maintain consistency and adhere to DRY principles.
- **Testing the API**: Created a Python script to test the Flask API using POST requests with JSON data.
- **Troubleshooting Errors**: Addressed '[Errno 111] Connection refused' and `ModuleNotFoundError` issues, ensuring the Flask server runs correctly and import paths are properly set.
- **Fixing Import Errors**: Resolved `ImportError` related to Flask Blueprints by adjusting the application structure.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and tested a Flask API for machine learning predictions.
- Resolved critical errors related to server connectivity and module imports.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the Flask application for production deployment.
- Comprehensive testing with additional datasets to ensure robustness.
