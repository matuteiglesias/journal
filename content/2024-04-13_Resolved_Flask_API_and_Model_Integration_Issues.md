**üïí 17:10‚Äì18:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flask, JavaScript, API, Debugging, Model Management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve various issues related to the integration of Flask APIs with JavaScript for model prediction and management.

### Key Activities
- **KeyError Troubleshooting:** Addressed a `KeyError` in the prediction logic by ensuring data consistency and proper preprocessing.
- **404 Error Resolution:** Resolved multiple `404 Not Found` errors by verifying route definitions, registering blueprints, and correcting AJAX requests in the Flask application.
- **Model Retrieval Update:** Modified the `get_models()` function and updated JavaScript code to dynamically populate dropdown menus with model filenames.
- **Model Metadata Management:** Improved the handling of model metadata in both JavaScript and Python.
- **Prediction Logic Integration:** Integrated data preprocessing and model prediction within the Flask `/predict` endpoint.
- **Git Commit Organization:** Structured Git commits for clarity and logical grouping.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved `404` errors and improved API endpoint accessibility.
- Enhanced the model selection and prediction logic in the web application.
- Improved the management and retrieval of model metadata.
- Organized Git commits to reflect best practices in version control.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the `/retrain` endpoint to ensure no additional `404` errors occur.
- Continuous monitoring and debugging of the Flask and JavaScript integration to maintain robust data flow.
