**üïí 00:40‚Äì02:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: EDA, Flask, Swagger, Python, Data Visualization, API  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the diamonds dataset and to document a Flask API using Swagger.

### Key Activities:
- Enhanced the EDA notebook for the diamonds dataset by improving visualizations with clearer plot titles and additional analyses using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Created subplots with scatter plots in Matplotlib to visualize data more effectively.
- Adjusted data preprocessing functions to filter out erroneous data entries, improving data quality for machine learning models.
- Streamlined the `preprocess_data` function for better efficiency and integration with machine learning workflows.
- Documented a Flask API using Swagger, including setting up OpenAPI documentation and integrating Swagger UI.
- Organized the `main.py` file in the Flask application to improve code maintainability and resolve blueprint registration conflicts.

### Achievements:
- Successfully enhanced the EDA process with improved data visualizations and preprocessing techniques.
- Documented a Flask API effectively using Swagger, ensuring clear and accessible API documentation.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced EDA notebook and Flask API documentation to ensure robustness and accuracy.
