**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a web crawler for an educational institution's website using Scrapy, focusing on internal links and optimizing its performance.

### Key Activities
- **Guideline Creation**: Developed detailed instructions for creating a web crawler using Scrapy, organizing link networks with NetworkX, and extracting specific information with BeautifulSoup.
- **Project Planning**: Planned the crawler project to systematically detect and organize all linked pages from the main faculty page, limiting exploration to 4 levels deep.
- **Crawler Configuration**: Configured the crawler to perform depth-limited searches and visualize link networks.
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzed Scrapy crawler logs to assess exploration depth, download statistics, duplicate handling, memory usage, and errors.
- **BFS Implementation**: Adjusted Scrapy settings to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) approach.
- **URL Filtering Optimization**: Enhanced the crawler to filter irrelevant URLs, improving data quality.
- **Connection Error Solutions**: Diagnosed and addressed connection errors related to `robots.txt`, including timeout adjustments and middleware configurations.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a crawler capable of exploring educational websites with improved link filtering and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the crawler's performance and error handling strategies may be needed as more data is collected and analyzed.
