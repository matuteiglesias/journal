## 📅 2024-05-26 — Session: Enhanced Data Processing Scripts with Error Handling and Cleanup

**🕒 11:10–12:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Error Handling, Cleanup, GitHub  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance and refactor Python scripts for downloading and processing data from GitHub repositories, with a focus on error handling, file management, and cleanup.

### Key Activities
- Developed a Python script to download and process data from GitHub, including handling configurations such as year range and file overwriting.
- Implemented error handling for downloading data files, including checks for 404 errors.
- Added functionality to handle missing files during data processing, ensuring concatenation only occurs if files are present.
- Included cleanup steps to remove temporary files after processing using the `shutil` module.
- Provided code snippets for data loading in both Python and R to facilitate data analysis.
- Fixed issues with boolean flag usage in argparse scripts, improving script reliability.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored data processing scripts to include robust error handling and cleanup procedures.
- Enhanced script reliability and maintainability by fixing argparse flag issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the scripts in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Documentation of the updated scripts for future reference.
