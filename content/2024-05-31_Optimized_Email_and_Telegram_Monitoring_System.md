**üïí 22:30‚Äì23:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: email processing, Telegram, Google Calendar, unit testing, code optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the email processing and Telegram monitoring systems by reducing print outputs during test execution, improving code efficiency, and enhancing functionality.

### Key Activities
- **Reducing Print Output:** Simplified code in `db_manager.py`, `test_db_manager.py`, `email_processor.py`, and their respective test files to minimize unnecessary print statements.
- **Email Processing Optimization:** Modified the `process_emails` function to limit the number of emails processed during tests, enhancing execution time and efficiency.
- **Test and Processing Optimization:** Improved test verbosity and efficiency, including limiting processed emails and adding print statements for tracking.
- **Telegram Monitor Enhancement:** Updated `telegram_monitor.py` to retrieve group names, contacts, and last messages, with tests in `test_telegram_monitor.py`.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Updated a script for Google Calendar integration, adding functions to get and delete events, with unit tests for functionality verification.
- **Database Management in Telegram Monitor:** Updated Telegram monitor code to correctly call `save_message` and adjusted database connection for reuse, with unit tests.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized email processing and Telegram monitoring systems.
- Enhanced Google Calendar integration with new functions and tests.
- Improved overall test efficiency and reduced unnecessary output.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the integration and testing processes for potential edge cases.

### Outcome
The session resulted in a more efficient and functional monitoring system for email and Telegram, with improved integration and testing strategies.
