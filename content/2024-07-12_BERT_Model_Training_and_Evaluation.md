**üïí 00:00‚Äì02:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: BERT, text classification, model training, NLP, data balancing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to execute a comprehensive workflow for training and evaluating a BERT model for text classification.

### Key Activities
- **BERT Model Training**: Followed a detailed workflow for installing necessary libraries, preparing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- **Handling Warnings**: Addressed common warnings during BERT fine-tuning, specifically related to newly initialized weights and the AdamW optimizer deprecation.
- **Training Loss Interpretation**: Analyzed training loss values to understand the model's learning progress and guide further training steps.
- **Debugging with Smaller Data Subsets**: Implemented classification on smaller data samples for debugging and testing, including tokenization and DataLoader creation.
- **Prediction Mapping**: Created a reverse mapping from numeric to textual labels for model predictions.
- **Data Balancing**: Resampled minority classes to handle unbalanced data before training.
- **Training Strategies**: Explored strategies to expedite BERT training, such as reducing epochs and using mixed precision training.

### Achievements
- Successfully trained and evaluated a BERT model with improved handling of warnings and optimized training strategies.
- Implemented effective data balancing techniques and prediction mapping.

### Pending Tasks
- Further tuning of hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy.
- Continued evaluation and testing with larger datasets.
