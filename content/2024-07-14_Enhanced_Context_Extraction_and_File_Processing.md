**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the context extraction process and streamline file processing for the 'libro GCP' project.

### Key Activities
- Developed a structured late-night work plan with music recommendations to boost productivity using the Pomodoro Technique.
- Streamlined the content generation process by integrating chapter contexts with a main dataframe, leveraging Python and OpenAI.
- Implemented a Python code to filter DataFrame based on specific patterns using regular expressions.
- Mapped 'Outline' values to contexts in a DataFrame, linking them to sections in a `filtered_outline.txt` file.
- Enhanced the `extract_context` function with partial matching using regular expressions for improved context extraction.
- Created a Python implementation for processing book sections by generating contexts with AI, saving them to files, and concatenating text files.

### Achievements
- Successfully improved the context extraction process with partial matching.
- Efficiently managed file operations, including concatenation of text files.

### Pending Tasks
- Validate the final document for the 'libro GCP' project to ensure all contexts are correctly extracted and integrated.
