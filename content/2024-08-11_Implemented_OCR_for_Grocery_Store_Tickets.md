### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on grocery store tickets to digitize and analyze the data.

### Key Activities
- Planned the OCR implementation using Tesseract and EasyOCR.
- Set up Tesseract OCR for Spanish language support.
- Explored alternative OCR solutions such as EasyOCR and cloud-based services.
- Installed and configured EasyOCR for local Python environment.
- Developed Python scripts to process images, perform OCR, and handle data.
- Implemented code to concatenate OCR text and save results to CSV.
- Integrated Pytesseract for OCR in Python scripts.
- Processed images to extract text and save results in text and CSV formats.
- Reconstructed and structured CSV data from extracted text.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and configured OCR tools for processing grocery store tickets.
- Developed a workflow to extract and structure data from images into CSV format.

### Pending Tasks
- Evaluate the accuracy of OCR results and make necessary adjustments.
- Consider further automation for continuous data processing.
