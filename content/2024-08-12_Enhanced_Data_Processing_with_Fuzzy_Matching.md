## 📅 2024-08-12 — Session: Enhanced Data Processing with Fuzzy Matching

**🕒 00:20–23:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Fuzzy Matching, Data Processing, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data processing capabilities by refining fuzzy matching techniques and ensuring robust data handling in Python.

### Key Activities
- **Updated `run_predict_save` Function:** Added an `overwrite` argument to manage file creation and loading, ensuring efficient data processing.
- **Handled Scikit-learn Version Inconsistencies:** Addressed warnings related to version mismatches, implementing strategies for consistent model saving and loading.
- **Inverted Matcher Datasets:** Developed a Python script to invert matcher datasets by comparing voter DataFrames against a merged list of unique names.
- **Custom Merging Strategy:** Implemented a strategy using Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching with a one-character tolerance, utilizing the `rapidfuzz` library.
- **Threshold in Fuzzy Matching:** Modified the `find_best_match` function to include a threshold, ensuring matches with a score above 95.
- **Chunk Processing with Fuzzy Matching:** Utilized the `fuzzywuzzy` library for chunk processing, saving intermediate results to CSV files.
- **Avoided SettingWithCopyWarning:** Used `.copy()` and `.loc[]` for safe DataFrame slice modifications, preventing common pandas warnings.

### Achievements
- Enhanced data processing techniques with improved fuzzy matching strategies.
- Ensured robust handling of data and warnings in Python.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of fuzzy matching algorithms for larger datasets.
- Explore additional libraries for performance improvements.
