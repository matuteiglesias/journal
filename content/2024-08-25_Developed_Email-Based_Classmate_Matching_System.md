## 📅 2024-08-25 — Session: Developed Email-Based Classmate Matching System

**🕒 22:10–23:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Email Lookup, Data Processing, Classmate Matching, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a Python-based system for identifying classmates using email addresses instead of traditional legajo numbers, aiming to streamline the lookup process and enhance data processing efficiency.

### Key Activities
- Evaluated the use of email addresses for identification and lookup purposes.
- Developed Python functions to find classmates using email addresses, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation.
- Implemented data processing steps to aggregate results by the most frequent matches for each email.
- Extracted maximum match emails and weights from DataFrames to identify best matches.
- Simplified data processing by eliminating unnecessary steps and applying thresholds.
- Optimized the classmate matching process by focusing on natural long formats and creating course identifiers.
- Generalized a function to find connections by email, merging results into a single DataFrame.
- Merged classmate data from lists of friends and foes to analyze relationships.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a modular and efficient email-based classmate matching system.
- Enhanced data processing efficiency by removing redundant steps and focusing on key data transformations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the system with larger datasets to ensure scalability and robustness.
- Integration of the system into existing data management workflows.
