## 📅 2024-08-25 — Session: Stable Diffusion Setup and Classmate Tracking Development

**🕒 15:40–19:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Stable Diffusion, Runpod, Database Management, Python, Image Generation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to troubleshoot and set up the Stable Diffusion environment on Runpod, and to develop a classmate tracking system using a database structure.

### Key Activities
- **Troubleshooting Stable Diffusion Setup**: Addressed issues with UI ports not initializing on Runpod using Kohya, ComfyUI, and InvokeAI. This included managing SSH connections and service statuses.
- **Image Generation for Logo Design**: Utilized Stable Diffusion for creating logos using prompt engineering and inpainting techniques.
- **Classmate Tracking System Development**: Planned and executed a database structure to track classmates across courses. Implemented Python scripts for data retrieval and processing, including grouping and summarizing classmates by course enrollment.

### Achievements
- Successfully managed and restarted services on Runpod for Stable Diffusion setup.
- Developed techniques for image generation using Stable Diffusion.
- Designed a database schema and implemented Python solutions for efficient classmate tracking.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the classmate tracking system for scalability.
- Continued refinement of image generation techniques using Stable Diffusion.
