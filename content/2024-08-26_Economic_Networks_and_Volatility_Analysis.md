**üìÇ Project**: Business  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on exploring the intricacies of economic networks and their role in aggregate volatility, alongside structuring academic and educational materials on the topic.

### Key Activities
1. **Variance Calculations and Network Structures**: Reflected on the importance of variance calculations and network structures in understanding economic volatility, emphasizing dominant terms and error propagation.
2. **Academic Paper Development**: Structured notes for developing a coherent academic paper, focusing on methodology and literature review.
3. **Revisiting Aggregate Volatility**: Critiqued Acemoglu et al.'s assumptions on aggregate volatility, proposing a nuanced input-output model.
4. **Abstract Revision**: Revised an abstract on economic shock propagation in network structures, highlighting model limitations.
5. **Modeling Shock Propagation**: Discussed network structures' impact on aggregate volatility, critiquing existing models and proposing refinements.
6. **Course Development**: Drafted notes and outlined a course on economic networks, covering the Leontieff Input-Output model and shock propagation.

### Achievements
- Developed insights into variance calculations and network structures.
- Structured a plan for an academic paper and course on economic networks.
- Proposed refined models for understanding economic volatility.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development of the academic paper and course materials.

### Outcomes
