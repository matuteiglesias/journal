## 📅 2024-08-28 — Session: Developed and Enhanced Data Processing Pipelines

**🕒 21:30–22:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Processing, Feature Engineering, Python, Web Scraping, Product Taxonomy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and enhance data processing pipelines for managing and analyzing product data efficiently.

### Key Activities
1. **Scripts for Merging Data Files**: Implemented Python scripts to merge price, product, and store data files, ensuring outputs are saved in the correct directories.
2. **Disk Usage Monitoring**: Utilized the `du` command to check disk usage, ensuring efficient storage management.
3. **Web Scraping Limits**: Applied limits on the number of stores per chain in the `PreciosClarosSpider` class to optimize web scraping.
4. **Product Data Challenges**: Addressed challenges in managing product data using techniques like text normalization, fuzzy matching, and clustering.
5. **Product Taxonomy and Feature Engineering**: Developed a product taxonomy and implemented KNN for product comparison, focusing on feature engineering and data preparation.
6. **Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline**: Outlined a comprehensive plan for data processing, including feature engineering, data preparation, and statistical analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully merged data files and monitored disk usage.
- Optimized web scraping processes.
- Developed strategies for product data management and taxonomy development.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue refining feature engineering techniques.
- Further evaluate and test the data processing pipeline.
