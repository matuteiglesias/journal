### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to refine and enhance economic and financial questions to challenge AI systems, incorporating advanced concepts in macroeconomics and finance.

### Key Activities
- **Refinement of Economic Questions:** Mat√≠as worked on enhancing a question about quantitative easing (QE) to include complex dynamics such as financial markets, interest rate expectations, and global macroeconomic context.
- **Feedback and Revisions:** Received feedback indicating that the revised QE question was too simplistic. Mat√≠as then formulated a more complex question to incorporate advanced economic principles and challenge AI systems.
- **Development of Financial Questions:** Revised a question about calculating the equivalent annual interest rate for a bond to incorporate broader economic principles, specifically comparing real and nominal interest rates.
- **Advanced Financial Analysis:** Developed a sophisticated question analyzing the impact of inflation uncertainty on real interest rates, incorporating risk premiums and stochastic processes.

### Achievements
- Successfully refined economic questions to incorporate advanced macroeconomic concepts.
- Developed complex financial questions involving real and nominal interest rates, inflation, and risk premiums.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the complexity of questions to ensure they challenge AI systems at a graduate level or higher.
