## 📅 2024-09-05 — Session: Nested Logit Model Refinement for Express Bus Choice

**🕒 22:20–23:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: nested logit model, probability, transportation, data analysis, model refinement  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to refine the nested logit model used for calculating the probability of a traveler choosing between Express and Local bus options, specifically focusing on the Red Express and Blue Express buses.

### Key Activities
- Detailed explanation and breakdown of the nested logit model structure and calculations, including inclusive values and probabilities.
- Revised the model structure to treat Blue and Red as separate nests.
- Adjusted the correlation parameter and analyzed its impact on the probability of choosing an Express bus.
- Recalculated logsum values and assessed the scaling factor's effect on model results.
- Identified discrepancies in the probability outcomes compared to expected values, suggesting further refinements.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into the structural setup of the nested logit model and the application of correlation parameters.
- Highlighted the need for further adjustments to align model outputs with expected probabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the scaling and handling of utilities in the nested logit model.
- Reassess the correlation parameter application to correct probability discrepancies.
