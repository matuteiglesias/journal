### Session Goal
The session aimed to deepen understanding and analysis of various statistical and economic models, focusing on interpretation, estimation, and application.

### Key Activities
- **Interpreted Logit Model Coefficients**: Clarified the distinction between log-odds and odds ratios in voting probability.
- **Estimated Betas in Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Provided a guide on using frequency data for estimation.
- **Interpreted Multinomial Logit Model Coefficients**: Focused on effects of education and voter status on voting likelihood.
- **Dynamic Optimization Model Analysis**: Explored household preferences and capital accumulation.
- **Steady-State Output Equations Analysis**: Evaluated neoclassical growth models and tax effects.
- **Calculated Critical Discount Factor in Cournot Duopoly**: Used Python to compute factors for collusion.
- **Equilibrium Action in Bayesian Equilibrium**: Analyzed sender's actions in equilibrium.
- **Nash Equilibrium and Collusion Analysis**: Reviewed and corrected calculations in Cournot duopoly.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into interpreting complex statistical models and economic theories.
- Developed Python scripts for economic model analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further validation and testing of economic model calculations.
- Application of insights to real-world data scenarios.
