### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to explore and implement multinomial logistic regression models to analyze voter behavior, focusing on transition probability models and statistical interpretations.

### Key Activities
- Developed a framework for modeling voter behavior using transition probability models, specifically focusing on multinomial logistic regression and Markov processes.
- Created challenging questions to test understanding of multinomial logistic regression.
- Installed `python-Levenshtein` to improve `fuzzywuzzy` performance.
- Implemented a multinomial logistic regression model to predict 2024 voting probability based on prior voting status and degree.
- Resolved data type errors in the regression model using `statsmodels`.
- Guided students in reconstructing a multinomial logistic regression model from group sizes.
- Analyzed voter behavior among Physics and Biology students using a multinomial logistic regression model.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and executed multinomial logistic regression models to analyze voter behavior.
- Enhanced string matching performance in Python by installing necessary libraries.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis on the impact of educational background on voting behavior using the constructed models.
