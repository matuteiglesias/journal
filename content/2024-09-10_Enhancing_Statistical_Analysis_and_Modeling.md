## 📅 2024-09-10 — Session: Enhancing Statistical Analysis and Modeling

**🕒 15:55–18:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: statistical analysis, Weibull model, job tenure, education, pricing strategy  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance statistical analysis questions, improve seller pricing strategy answer options, and refine research questions related to job tenure analysis.

### Key Activities
- Revised statistical analysis questions focusing on the relative magnitudes of coefficients in a Weibull hazard model for job tenure.
- Improved answer options for a seller's pricing strategy by incorporating feedback and enhancing complexity.
- Refined research questions on the effects of education, sector, and gender on job tenure.
- Adjusted statistical questions for manual interpretation and simplified log-likelihood calculations.
- Examined Weibull distribution in log-linear models and estimated coefficients based on differences in mean log-durations.
- Updated tables with education sector counts and durations.

### Achievements
- Developed a structured approach to analyzing job tenure using Weibull distribution and log-linear models.
- Enhanced understanding of statistical modeling through manual calculation methods.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of statistical questions for educational purposes.
- Continued development of complex answer options for business strategy questions.
