**🏷️ Labels**: spaCy, NLP, Spanish, parser, entity extraction  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance natural language processing capabilities by developing a parser for Spanish sentence structures using spaCy.

### Key Activities
- Installed the Spanish language model (`es_core_news_sm`) in spaCy.
- Analyzed sentence structures and dependencies, focusing on identifying key components such as subjects, actions, and locations.
- Developed and updated parser logic to improve entity extraction accuracy in Spanish sentences.
- Implemented a smart parser design utilizing dependency parsing and named entity recognition (NER).

### Achievements
- Successfully installed and ran the Spanish language model in spaCy.
- Enhanced parser logic for better accuracy in identifying sentence components.
- Created a workflow for structured data extraction from Spanish sentences.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the parser with diverse Spanish text samples to ensure robustness.
