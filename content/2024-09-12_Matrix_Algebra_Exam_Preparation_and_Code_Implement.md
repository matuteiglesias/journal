**üïí 17:25‚Äì18:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Linear Algebra, Python, Education, GitHub, Matrix Operations  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to prepare exam exercises and implement code solutions for teaching linear algebra concepts, including matrix inversion, Gaussian elimination, and base change in vector spaces.

### Key Activities
- **Exam Exercise Proposal:** Designed exercises to evaluate students on matrix inversion, base change, and solving systems of linear equations.
- **Code Implementation:** Developed Python functions for matrix operations such as row echelon transformation, matrix inversion using back substitution, and Gaussian elimination.
- **Numerical Precision Review:** Addressed numerical precision issues in matrix inversion calculations, suggesting improvements using `np.allclose`.
- **GitHub Setup:** Organized student submissions via Git, including repository setup and instructions for exam submissions.
- **Algorithm Correction:** Corrected the Gaussian elimination algorithm to ensure proper storage of reduction factors in matrix L.

### Achievements
- Created a comprehensive set of linear algebra exercises for educational purposes.
- Enhanced Python scripts for matrix operations, improving both functionality and accuracy.
- Established a GitHub-based workflow for managing student submissions effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further review of numerical precision adjustments in matrix calculations.
- Continuous monitoring and feedback on student submissions through GitHub.
