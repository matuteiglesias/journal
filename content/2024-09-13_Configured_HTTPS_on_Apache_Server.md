- **Installing Apache Plugin for Certbot**: Installed the necessary Apache plugin for Certbot to facilitate SSL configuration.
- **Configuring SSL for Virtual Hosts**: Selected the correct virtual host in Certbot and configured SSL certificates, followed by verification and Apache server restart.
- **Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS**: Configured the server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, ensuring secure access to the site.

### Achievements
