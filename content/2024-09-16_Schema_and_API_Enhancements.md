**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve schema key resolutions, enhance text processing for schema extraction, troubleshoot file download issues, and explore OpenAI API functionalities.

### Key Activities
- Evaluated schema keys for resolutions, suggesting improvements for granularity and distinctions between terms like 'Convenios' and 'Acuerdos'.
- Refined the stems dictionary and match function to facilitate dynamic schema extraction for knowledge graphs.
- Analyzed schema key mapping effectiveness for categorizing resolutions from the 'Ministerio de Seguridad' dataset.
- Enhanced the stems dictionary for legal terms, improving detection of schema keys related to licitations, convenios, and designaciones.
- Troubleshot file download issues, suggesting saving data as a CSV and offering alternative solutions for file integration.
- Explored OpenAI API documentation for agent functionality, focusing on API syntax and function calling.
- Set up OpenAI API for functions and fine-tuning, including defining functions and enforcing schema constraints.
- Integrated AI agents with NoSQL schema using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Migrated to OpenAI Python API v1.0.0, providing guidance on automated migration tools and manual adjustments.
- Fixed TypeError in OpenAI API usage, correcting parameters for chat and text completions.
- Accessed responses in OpenAI API, detailing differences between chat models and text completion models.

### Achievements
- Improved schema key resolution and text processing for schema extraction.
- Successfully troubleshot file download issues and explored OpenAI API functionalities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of schema extraction processes and continued exploration of OpenAI API capabilities.
