**üïí 05:30‚Äì06:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: data analysis, regression modeling, economic forecasting, poverty estimation, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to perform data analysis and regression modeling to predict future economic indicators and estimate poverty levels using linear regression techniques.

### Key Activities
- **Linear Extrapolation of Economic Data**: Implemented linear regression models to predict future values of Canasta B√°sica Alimentaria, IPC, and RIPTE datasets using the last four months of data.
- **Forecasting Labor Statistics**: Developed methods for forecasting labor statistics by adjusting for seasonal differences and visualizing results.
- **Poverty Prediction Models**: Explored and outlined regression models to predict poverty levels based on employment metrics and economic indicators.
- **Data Preparation for Regression**: Prepared time series datasets for regression modeling by combining economic indicators and handling missing data.
- **Quadratic Spline Interpolation**: Applied quadratic spline interpolation to convert quarterly data into monthly data.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Implemented methods for handling missing values in regression models using Python and sklearn.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and implemented several regression models for economic forecasting and poverty estimation.
- Prepared datasets for analysis and handled missing data effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further validation and testing of the regression models, particularly for poverty estimation.
- Exploration of additional economic indicators for more comprehensive models.
