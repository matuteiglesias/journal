### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to explore and develop proposals for AI and data projects that showcase skills in data usage, AI, and modern tools.

### Key Activities
- Proposed various ideas for AI and data projects, including a data explorer prototype, automatic report generation, a data-based chatbot, trend detection, and future scenario simulations.
- Detailed a system for generating automatic reports from NoSQL data, including steps for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and automation.
- Developed a project to parse legal resolutions and extract structured data into a NoSQL schema, focusing on accuracy and schema design.
- Outlined frameworks for generating reports from JSON data and methods for entity extraction and data aggregation.
- Provided Python code snippets for n-gram frequency calculation from NoSQL JSON data and addressed JSON file loading issues in Python.
- Analyzed the structure of JSON data for consistency and complexity, highlighting areas for improvement in data extraction and normalization.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for AI and data project proposals.
- Developed a detailed workflow for automatic report generation from NoSQL data.
- Created a schema design for legal resolution data extraction.
- Provided solutions for JSON data handling in Python.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed AI and data projects.
- Continue refining the schema design for legal resolutions.
- Further develop the report generation framework from JSON data.
