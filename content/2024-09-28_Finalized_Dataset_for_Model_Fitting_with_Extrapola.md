## 📅 2024-09-28 — Session: Finalized Dataset for Model Fitting with Extrapolation

**🕒 16:05–16:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data analysis, forecasting, time series, Python, pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to finalize a dataset for model fitting by extending it with forecasted values to ensure continuity and accuracy in time series analysis.

### Key Activities
- Finalized the dataset by concatenating historical data with extrapolated values.
- Extended the DataFrame to January 2025 using linear extrapolation and a combination of linear extrapolation with median month differences.
- Implemented extrapolation functions to handle individual last valid dates for various time series columns.
- Corrected the extrapolation method to avoid NaN issues and ensure independent handling of each series.
- Merged extrapolated values correctly into the existing DataFrame, avoiding the creation of new rows for each column.

### Achievements
- Successfully extended the dataset with forecasted values, ensuring continuity and accuracy.
- Developed a robust method for extrapolating time series data and merging it into the existing DataFrame.

### Pending Tasks
- Validate the accuracy of the extrapolated data through model fitting and testing.
- Document the process and code for future reference and reproducibility.
