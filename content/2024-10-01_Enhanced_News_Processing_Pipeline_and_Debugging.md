### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive plan for enhancing the news scraping setup.
- Outlined and implemented the `NewsDataCollector` bot to scrape news from RSS feeds and store them in a SQLite database.
- Implemented verbose unit tests for the `NewsDataCollector` to ensure data integrity.
- Enhanced a Python function for news collection with verbose print statements for better debugging.
- Debugged issues related to news article storage, including database insertion errors and key mismatches.
- Revised the `save_to_db` method to ensure the news table exists before data insertion.

### Achievements
- Successfully planned and executed enhancements to the news processing pipeline.
- Implemented and tested the `NewsDataCollector` bot with improved error handling and logging.

### Pending Tasks
- Further integration of NLP features for keyword extraction and classification.
- Full automation of the news triage process.
