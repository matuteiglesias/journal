### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to plan and initiate the development of a keyword extraction class that can process various data sources, such as RSS feeds, emails, and news articles, to facilitate initial classification before further handling by AI agents.

### Key Activities
- Planned the creation of a keyword extraction class for processing diverse data sources.
- Outlined steps for building a flexible keyword extraction and classification system using Python, focusing on handling data from RSS feeds, emails, and news articles.
- Developed a flexible data ingestion and processing architecture for keyword extraction and classification.
- Confirmed readiness to proceed with the development of the keyword extraction class, emphasizing integration into a data ingestion pipeline.
- Outlined the objectives and structure of a data ingestion pipeline designed for efficient data processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully planned the architecture and initial steps for developing a keyword extraction class.
- Established a clear framework for integrating keyword extraction into a data ingestion pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Proceed with the actual coding and implementation of the keyword extraction class.
- Test and validate the integration of the class within the data ingestion pipeline.
