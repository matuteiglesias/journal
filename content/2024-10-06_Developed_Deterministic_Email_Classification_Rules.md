**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop deterministic rules for categorizing emails into various categories such as 'Discard', 'Discussion', 'Event', 'Financial Notifications', 'Job Postings', 'Networking', 'Opportunities', 'Promotions', and 'Security Alerts'.

### Key Activities

- Provided pseudocode frameworks for implementation.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the pseudocode into a working email classification system.
- Test and validate the classification rules with real email data.
