**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize data structures for educational systems and implement advanced data manipulation techniques in Google Sheets and Excel.

### Key Activities
1. **Redesign of Database Tables**: Proposed a redesign of tables to optimize data structures in an educational system, focusing on tables for students, tutors, subjects, and Individualized Study Plans (PEI).
2. **Google Sheets Simulation**: Explained how to simulate the 'stack' function from pandas in Google Sheets using ARRAYFORMULA, FLATTEN, and FILTER.
3. **PEI Data Structure Proposal**: Presented a proposal to improve the PEI data structure by adopting a 'long' format for enhanced efficiency.
4. **Google Sheets Automation**: Developed methods to extract the latest date using Google Sheets formulas like FILTER, SORT, and INDEX.
5. **Excel Formula Implementation**: Provided Excel formulas for retrieving the latest date based on criteria, with detailed breakdowns and error handling strategies.

### Achievements
- Completed a comprehensive redesign proposal for database tables in educational systems.
- Successfully implemented data manipulation techniques in Google Sheets and Excel.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and test the proposed database redesign in a live environment.
- Further refine Excel and Google Sheets formulas for additional use cases.
