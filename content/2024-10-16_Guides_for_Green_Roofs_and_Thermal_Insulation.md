**🕒 18:40–19:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: green roof, thermal insulation, sustainability, EPS panels, home improvement  
**📂 Project**: Other  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to explore and document methods for sustainable building practices, specifically focusing on green roofs and thermal insulation using expanded polystyrene (EPS) panels.

**Key Activities:**
- Reviewed a guide on installing extensive green roofs, covering structural review, waterproofing, drainage, plant selection, and benefits such as low maintenance and thermal performance.
- Evaluated the use of EPS panels (telgopor) as an economical solution for improving thermal insulation in metal roofs.
- Developed instructions for installing EPS panels, including recommended thickness and fastening methods, supported by a lightweight frame.

**Achievements:**
- Compiled a comprehensive guide for the installation of extensive green roofs.
- Established a plan for enhancing thermal insulation using EPS panels, with detailed installation instructions.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further research on plant selection for green roofs to optimize sustainability and performance.
- Testing and validation of the EPS panel installation method in a real-world scenario to ensure efficacy and safety.
