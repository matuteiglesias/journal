## 📅 2024-10-26 — Session: Enhanced Task Scheduling with OR-Tools

**🕒 21:10–22:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: task scheduling, OR-Tools, Python, constraints, DataFrame  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance a task scheduling system using Python and Google OR-Tools, focusing on dynamic constraint management and multi-day task distribution.

### Key Activities
- Developed a three-day task scheduling workflow using OR-Tools and Pandas for calendar visualization.
- Implemented a scheduling model with CSV constraints, addressing data type conversion issues.
- Enhanced dynamic constraint processing and troubleshooting infeasibility in scheduling models.
- Fixed TypeErrors and indexing errors in task instance handling, ensuring accurate DataFrame population.
- Integrated frequency-based task replication and improved task scheduling logic for multi-day distribution.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented dynamic scheduling constraints from a CSV file.
- Resolved multiple TypeErrors and indexing issues, enhancing the scheduling algorithm's robustness.
- Achieved a functional multi-day task scheduling system with frequency constraints.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the scheduling system under different scenarios.
- Optimization of constraint processing to improve performance.
