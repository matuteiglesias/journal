**🕒 15:20–15:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: scheduling, task management, algorithms, productivity, Python  
**📂 Project**: Business  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore smart scheduling algorithms to optimize Matías's calendar and enhance task management efficiency.

### Key Activities
- Discussed various smart scheduling algorithms and their role in task management.
- Explored the concept of heuristics in problem-solving, particularly in scheduling.
- Outlined the use of Genetic Algorithms and Constraint Programming as scheduling agents.
- Reflected on Matías's daily schedule and task management strategy.
- Developed a structured approach to scheduling constraints.
- Implemented programmatic scheduling constraints using Python.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into different scheduling algorithms and their applications.
- Developed a framework for implementing scheduling constraints programmatically.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of hybrid scheduling approaches combining Genetic Algorithms and Constraint Programming.
