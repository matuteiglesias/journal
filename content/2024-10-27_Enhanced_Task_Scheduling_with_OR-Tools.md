## 📅 2024-10-27 — Session: Enhanced Task Scheduling with OR-Tools

**🕒 14:30–17:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: task scheduling, OR-Tools, Python, constraints, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the task scheduling model using OR-Tools, focusing on non-overlapping constraints and optimizing the scheduling logic.

### Key Activities
- **Refined Task Scheduling Constraints**: Implemented a refined approach to scheduling tasks using constraints to prevent overlaps and ensure realistic time distribution across days with OR-Tools.
- **Corrected Non-Overlapping Constraints**: Addressed errors in OR-Tools related to using conditional constraints on non-Boolean expressions.
- **Dynamic CSV-Based Logic**: Incorporated non-overlapping constraints into a dynamic task scheduling system using CSV inputs.
- **Binary Occupancy Matrix**: Managed task scheduling using a binary occupancy matrix to prevent overlapping tasks.
- **Optimized Scheduling Model**: Improved the scheduling model by addressing frequency distribution and preventing overlapping tasks.
- **Handling Various Errors**: Resolved multiple errors including KeyError, IndexError, and TypeError in the scheduling code.
- **Integration of AddNoOverlap Constraint**: Integrated the `AddNoOverlap` constraint within the task scheduling model to prevent task overlap.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a more robust task scheduling model using OR-Tools.
- Ensured non-overlapping scheduling of tasks through various constraint programming techniques.
- Optimized the scheduling logic and resolved multiple coding errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the scheduling model in real-world scenarios.
- Integration of additional task types and constraints as needed.
