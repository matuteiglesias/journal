## 📅 2024-10-27 — Session: Task Scheduling and Constraint Management

**🕒 20:20–23:49**  
**🏷️ Labels**: task scheduling, automation, constraints, Python, optimization  
**📂 Project**: Automation  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The aim of this session was to enhance and optimize task scheduling methodologies, focusing on constraint management and dynamic scheduling.

### Key Activities
- Developed and refined Python scripts for transforming DataFrames into dictionary structures for task management.
- Updated constraints CSV with new task IDs and expanded it to include additional tasks and frequency constraints.
- Implemented and corrected scheduling logic for the 'Morning Routine' to start immediately after a designated 'Sleep' block.
- Designed a task distribution plan for a 30-day period, balancing workload and frequency-based assignments.
- Enhanced task assignment with verbose output for detailed tracking.
- Improved task scheduling methodology to ensure tasks start on the preferred day and optimized frequency distribution.
- Implemented time constraints for scheduling workout tasks to start after 19:00.

### Achievements
- Successfully transformed datasets for task management and implemented dynamic scheduling models.
- Corrected and adapted scheduling logic for specific routines, improving overall task management efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further adjustments and testing of the scheduling system to ensure robustness and flexibility in task assignments.
