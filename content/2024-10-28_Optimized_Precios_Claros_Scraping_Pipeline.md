### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance and optimize the Precios Claros scraping pipeline to improve efficiency in capturing and storing price data.

### Key Activities
- **Refinement of Scraping Pipeline**: Enhanced the existing pipeline with structured directories and consolidation scripts to better manage datasets.
- **Command Filtering**: Utilized Unix `grep` commands to filter command history for scraping-related activities, focusing on `scrapy` and `shub`.
- **Debugging Techniques**: Implemented a debug-friendly command using Scrapy for efficient data collection and debugging.
- **Automated Scraper Setup**: Outlined a sustainable approach to automate web scraping using cloud infrastructure, error handling, and version control.
- **Server Setup on GCP**: Configured a cost-effective server on Google Cloud Platform for running web scrapers.
- **CSV Management Automation**: Developed a Python script for managing price data in CSV format, addressing price volatility and data enrichment.
- **Daily ETL Optimization**: Designed an advanced ETL process using Pandas for efficient price data management.
- **Multiple Scrapers Execution**: Set up multiple Scrapy spiders in VS Code notebooks for streamlined data processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized the Precios Claros scraping pipeline for daily price data capture.
- Improved data management and storage efficiency through automation and cloud solutions.
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with `ipdb` in various environments.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new ETL process.
- Continuous monitoring and logging enhancements for long-term maintenance.
