**🕒 18:30–19:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: SVD, image compression, teaching, data analysis, Python  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop a structured outline and educational approach for a notebook focused on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression.

### Key Activities
- Created a detailed outline for a notebook on SVD image compression, covering setup, analysis, and exercises.
- Planned an educational approach for teaching SVD and its application in image compression, emphasizing key theoretical aspects and data reduction efficiency.
- Developed an exercise for practical application of SVD in image compression, focusing on quality evaluation.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined the structure for an SVD image compression notebook.
- Established a comprehensive teaching approach for SVD in image compression.
- Designed a practical exercise for students to apply SVD in real-world scenarios.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the outlined notebook and teaching materials.
- Conduct testing and refinement of the exercises.
- Gather feedback from initial teaching sessions to improve content.
