### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve a linear algebra exercise involving subspaces in \(R^4\), define linear transformations, and calculate orthogonal projections using Python for symbolic computations. Additionally, the session focused on correcting the implementation of the Gram-Schmidt process in Python.

### Key Activities
- Resolved an algebra exercise involving linear transformations and orthogonal projections using Python libraries such as SymPy and NumPy.
- Presented results of orthogonal projection of a set of generators onto a subspace, including the orthonormal basis and projection matrix.
- Corrected the Gram-Schmidt process implementation to handle symbolic matrices, addressing type errors and ensuring matrices are treated correctly in Python.
- Initiated the screening process for knowledge organization in the Mat√≠as Automation Lab.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the algebra exercise and computed the orthogonal projections.
- Corrected multiple issues in the Gram-Schmidt implementation, ensuring proper matrix operations and initialization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the screening process for knowledge management.
- Validation of the corrected Gram-Schmidt implementation with additional test cases.
