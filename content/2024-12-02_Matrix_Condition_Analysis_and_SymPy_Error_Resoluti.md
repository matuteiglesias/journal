**üïí 15:35‚Äì17:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: matrices, SymPy, numerical analysis, Python, matrix condition, error resolution  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on analyzing the condition of lower triangular matrices and resolving errors in matrix operations using SymPy.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed the condition of lower triangular matrix \( A_n \) in terms of \( \text{Cond}_\infty \) and \( \text{Cond}_2 \), demonstrating their tendency to infinity as \( n \) increases.
- Presented results for matrix \( A \) for \( n=3 \), including its inverse, infinity norms, and condition number.
- Resolved a SymPy error related to matrix row assignment by converting lists to compatible Matrix objects and applying a lower triangular mask.
- Reconstructed matrix \( A \) using individual entries to maintain the lower triangular structure.
- Analyzed a singular matrix \( B \) to provide a lower bound for the condition number of \( A \).
- Simplified the result of the difference between two matrices for further analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully demonstrated the numerical sensitivity of matrix \( A \) through condition number analysis.
- Corrected SymPy matrix manipulation errors and improved code structure.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of symbolic matrix differences and their infinity norms.
- Exploration of additional properties of matrix norms and conditions.
