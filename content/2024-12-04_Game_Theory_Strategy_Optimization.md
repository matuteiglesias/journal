## 📅 2024-12-04 — Session: Game Theory Strategy Optimization

**🕒 19:55–20:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: game theory, strategy, expected payoff, optimization, numerical methods  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize strategies in game theory, focusing on maximizing expected payoffs against opponents with varying strategies.

### Key Activities
- Evaluated numerical solutions for optimal strategies in game theory.
- Analyzed expected payoffs using custom strategies and distributions.
- Implemented Python strategies to handle multiple probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
- Initiated a screening process for knowledge management in the Matías Automation Lab.
- Addressed errors in symbolic evaluation of piecewise expressions using numerical integration.
- Verified optimal strategies for single and multiple opponent scenarios.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified optimal strategies for maximizing expected payoffs in different game scenarios.
- Developed a structured approach to evaluate expected returns and manage symbolic evaluation errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of strategies based on additional opponent data.
- Continued development of automation processes for knowledge management.
