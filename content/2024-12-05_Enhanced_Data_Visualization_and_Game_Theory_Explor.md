## üìÖ 2024-12-05 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization and Game Theory Exploration

**üïí 14:35‚Äì16:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Visualization, Game Theory, Python, Bayesian Inference  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using Python libraries and explore foundational and advanced concepts in game theory.

### Key Activities
1. **Updated Contour Plot**: Implemented a double-line effect in contour plots using Matplotlib to improve visual clarity.
2. **Enhanced Seaborn Plot**: Improved plot aesthetics by modifying color palettes, grid lines, legend styling, and typography.
3. **Game Theory Exploration**: Explored two-player game theory scenarios focusing on expected payoffs and optimization strategies.
4. **Probabilistic Modeling**: Developed functions for probabilistic modeling in game theory to calculate expected payoffs.
5. **Bayesian Inference Resources**: Compiled resources for Bayesian inference and game theory applications in investing.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Developed a deeper understanding of game theory concepts, including Bayesian Nash Equilibrium.
- Compiled a comprehensive list of resources for further exploration of Bayesian inference in finance.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of Bayesian games in multi-player scenarios.
- Application of enhanced visualization techniques in other data analysis projects.
