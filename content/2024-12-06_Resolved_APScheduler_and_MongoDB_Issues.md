- Improved MongoDB data handling and operations.
- Resolved RabbitMQ queue management errors.
- Established a structured approach for job data extraction and analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated job data extraction schema and AI prompts.
- Continuous monitoring of APScheduler and RabbitMQ for any recurring issues.
