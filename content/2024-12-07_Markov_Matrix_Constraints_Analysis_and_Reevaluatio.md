## 📅 2024-12-07 — Session: Markov Matrix Constraints Analysis and Reevaluation

**🕒 17:20–18:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Markov Matrix, Mathematics, Constraints, Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on analyzing and solving constraints within Markov matrices, particularly addressing issues with row sums and matrix convergence.

### Key Activities
- **Preparation for Upcoming AI Session:** Outlined necessary steps for topic selection and resource gathering.
- **Markov Matrix Constraints Analysis:** Analyzed a Markov matrix to determine values for variables a and b, confirming a = 1 and b = -1/2.
- **Reevaluation of Problem Constraints:** Identified issues with row sums not equaling 1, leading to a reevaluation of constraints.
- **Analysis of Matrix Convergence:** Discussed the convergence behavior of matrix P and implications for steady states, suggesting P∞ does not exist.
- **Understanding Column-Sum Convention:** Explored the implications of using column-sum conventions in Markov processes.
- **Analysis of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** Detailed the implications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrix dynamics.

### Achievements
- Corrected analysis of Markov matrix constraints, validating the values of a and b.
- Identified and planned for addressing inconsistencies in matrix constraints.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of initial state evolution to determine the existence of a stationary state.

### Timeframe
**Start Time:** 17:20  
**End Time:** 18:00
