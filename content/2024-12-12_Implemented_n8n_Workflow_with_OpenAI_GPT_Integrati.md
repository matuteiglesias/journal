**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement a 'Hello Staff Manager' workflow in n8n that integrates with a Python script and GPT assistant for two-way communication.

### Key Activities
- Created a detailed implementation plan for the 'Hello Staff Manager' workflow in n8n.
- Provided a step-by-step guide on using a Manual Trigger node in n8n workflows.
- Set up a manual trigger workflow to integrate with a GPT assistant for querying the Staff Manager and emailing the response.
- Configured the OpenAI GPT API within the n8n HTTP Request Node, detailing the method, URL, headers, and body format.
- Fixed configuration errors in the OpenAI API request, specifically correcting the placement of the `model` parameter.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a manual trigger workflow in n8n for integrating with a GPT assistant.
- Correctly configured the OpenAI GPT API for use within n8n workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the workflow to ensure robust error handling and integration stability.
