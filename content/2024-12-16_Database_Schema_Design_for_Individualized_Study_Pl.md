- Discussed data redundancy and normalization principles in database design.
- Delivered DDL for PEI_Materias and Materias tables in DBML format, with necessary indexes and table structure explanations.
- Defined the structure of the `id_pei` identifier to ensure uniqueness and traceability.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined a comprehensive schema for PEIs with considerations for scalability and normalization.
- Resolved key duplication issues and improved database design practices.

### Pending Tasks
