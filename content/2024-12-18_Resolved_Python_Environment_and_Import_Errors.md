- Troubleshot Python environment setup issues in VSCode, focusing on interpreter selection.
- Implemented per-email exception handling in an email fetching function to ensure robust error logging and fallback mechanisms.
- Configured `systemd` service to correctly set `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` for Python scripts.
- Addressed ImportError for 'Sequence' in Python 3.11 by exploring patching, upgrading, or downgrading solutions.
- Resolved AttributeError due to `importlib.metadata` conflicts by uninstalling conflicting packages and ensuring clean dependency management.
- Debugged issues in task briefings related to API downtime and filtering errors.
- Upgraded Trio library to resolve compatibility issues with Python 3.11.
- Troubleshot SmartMonitor scheduler dependencies and service status.

### Achievements
