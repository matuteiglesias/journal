**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and debug a PDF processing application using Flask, Python, and various libraries like LangChain and Chroma.

### Key Activities
- Created a rapid development plan for a PDF processing app.
- Implemented a Flask application for PDF ingestion and query processing.
- Integrated the Raptor Pipeline with the Flask app for enhanced document processing.
- Resolved installation errors for the `langchain_chroma` module.
- Compared different PDF processing implementations for future improvements.
- Fixed issues related to Conda environment initialization and module import errors.
- Streamlined the text ingestion and querying pipeline.
- Debugged issues related to missing columns in DataFrames during processing.
- Prevented premature execution of recursive functions in the app.
- Enhanced logging verbosity for better debugging and error handling.
- Resolved HTTP 415 errors and form submission issues in Flask endpoints.
- Verified and reinstalled Python modules as needed.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a functional PDF processing application capable of text extraction, embedding, and querying.
- Improved the robustness and error handling of the application.
- Enhanced the logging and debugging capabilities of the system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the PDF processing workflow.
- Exploration of additional enhancements for the document processing pipeline.
