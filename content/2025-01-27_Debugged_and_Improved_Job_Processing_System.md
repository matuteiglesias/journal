### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug and enhance the job processing system, focusing on improving the reliability of job message handling and data integration with Google Sheets.

### Key Activities
- **Debugging Job Posting Processing Logic**: Identified logical gaps and potential causes for issues in the job posting workflow, implementing robust logging and validation steps.
- **System Observations and Improvements**: Highlighted issues with unprocessed job messages and suggested debugging steps to enhance logging, filtering, and processing reliability.
- **Fixing Duplicate Row Insertion**: Improved the Google Sheets script logic to prevent duplicate rows by using unique identifiers.
- **Testing process_job_message Function**: Conducted isolated tests using Python's unittest framework, including mocking dependencies.
- **MongoDB Workflow Test Script**: Simulated job data enrichment and verified results using a MongoDB script.
- **OpenAI API Key Setup**: Set up and debugged the OpenAI API key environment variable for integration in Python scripts.

### Achievements
- Successfully enriched job data for PhD positions, extracted metadata, and validated data insertion into the ATS.
- Enhanced the Google Sheets integration by preventing data duplication and optimizing data sync.

### Pending Tasks
- Further monitoring of the job processing system to ensure ongoing reliability and performance improvements.
