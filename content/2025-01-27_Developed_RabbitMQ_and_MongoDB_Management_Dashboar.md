### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design and implement a lightweight dashboard for managing RabbitMQ and MongoDB using Flask for the backend and plain HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.

### Key Activities
- Designed a custom RabbitMQ dashboard with HTML and JavaScript.
- Fixed a `404 Not Found` error in Flask by defining a root route.
- Developed a Flask application to display RabbitMQ queue counts and MongoDB collection counts.
- Updated the `/stats` endpoint to integrate `MongoHandler` for MongoDB operations.
- Implemented a Flask endpoint to delete specific MongoDB collections.
- Provided instructions for deleting MongoDB collections using `mongosh`.
- Added an endpoint in Flask to serve `index.html`.
- Explained the use of Flask's `render_template` function.
- Made MongoDB collections clickable in the frontend.
- Updated backend and frontend for MongoDB data processing.
- Redesigned frontend table structure for better data handling.
- Enhanced queue messages display with a structured table format.
- Implemented dynamic JSON parsing and table rendering for RabbitMQ messages.
- Fixed data parsing and display issues for backend and frontend.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a functional dashboard for RabbitMQ and MongoDB management.
- Improved data handling and display in both backend and frontend.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the dashboard for performance and user experience.
- Consider additional features such as user authentication and role-based access control.
