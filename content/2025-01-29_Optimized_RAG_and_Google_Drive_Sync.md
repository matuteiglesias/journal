**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize data management and synchronization processes using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and rclone for Google Drive.

### Key Activities
- **Rclone Synchronization**: Implemented synchronization of local folders with Google Drive using rclone, including handling of empty directories and bi-directional sync.
- **RAG Bucket Design**: Optimized the design of RAG buckets for efficient AI retrieval, focusing on structured data and metadata tagging.
- **Folder Structure Design**: Developed a comprehensive folder structure for RAG workflows, integrating with Supabase for teaching, accounting, and political narratives.
- **Teaching Directory Critique**: Critiqued and suggested improvements for a teaching folder structure to enhance usability and scalability.

### Achievements
- Successfully synchronized local and cloud directories using rclone, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- Established a robust RAG bucket design to support AI-driven data retrieval.
- Created a scalable and organized folder structure for diverse workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further automation of the RAG pipeline and synchronization processes.
- Implementation of suggested improvements for the teaching directory structure.
