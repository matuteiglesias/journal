**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to design and implement a Books Orchestrator for processing books into chunked text files with metadata, and to optimize chunk management before integrating with a vector store.

### Key Activities
- Designed the Books Orchestrator to process books in various formats, converting them into chunked text files with metadata.
- Enhanced a PDF text extraction script for better debugging, logging, and metadata generation.
- Debugged and improved a script for PDF and text processing, focusing on logging and real-time feedback.
- Developed an automated directory watcher script using the `watchdog` library to monitor changes and rerun processing scripts.
- Troubleshot subprocess execution issues in the watcher script, improving error logging and reliability.
- Optimized chunk management system, validating chunk generation and metadata handling.
- Designed a modular chunk storage system for vector data, focusing on metadata schema and storage options.
- Enhanced `chunking.py` for document processing, ensuring compatibility with indexing methods.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and implemented a Books Orchestrator.
- Improved PDF processing scripts with better logging and debugging.
- Developed a reliable directory watcher for automated processing.
- Optimized chunk management and storage systems.

### Pending Tasks
- Integrate the optimized chunk management system with the vector store.
- Further testing and validation of the Books Orchestrator and chunk management modules.
