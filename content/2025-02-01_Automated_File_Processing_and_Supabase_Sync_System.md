**🏷️ Labels**: automation, Supabase, file processing, Python, error handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design and implement an automated system for file processing and synchronization with Supabase.

### Key Activities
- Designed a system to monitor file changes, process files by chunking, and sync with Supabase.
- Developed a Python script for efficient file processing using multithreading.
- Integrated a watcher script with Supabase for automated file processing.
- Troubleshot and resolved Supabase library installation and import issues.
- Conducted error analysis and implemented fixes for Supabase file management.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined the design of an automated file processing system.
- Implemented a multithreaded Python script for file processing.
- Integrated Supabase sync with a file system watcher.
- Resolved library issues and improved error handling in Supabase file management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the file processing and synchronization system.
