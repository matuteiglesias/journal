## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Resolved Supabase 'created_at' Column Error and Enhanced RAG System

**🕒 17:00–17:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Supabase, RAG, embeddings, error handling, vectorstores  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve a 'created_at' column error in the Supabase 'chunks' table and to enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system setup.

### Key Activities
- **Supabase Error Fix**: Followed a guide to troubleshoot and resolve the missing 'created_at' column error in the Supabase 'chunks' table, including checks for table structure, payload inspection, cache clearing, and debugging code.
- **File Upload Logic**: Improved a Python function for uploading file metadata to Supabase, focusing on graceful error handling.
- **RAG System Setup**: Implemented a dynamic RAG system using chunked data, focusing on data organization, dynamic querying, and semantic searches with tools like FAISS and Weaviate.
- **Embeddings and Retrieval**: Developed strategies for using embeddings in data retrieval and model training, emphasizing metadata for context reconstruction.
- **Vectorstores Management**: Managed vectorstores for RAG workflows, including creating, filtering, saving, and reusing vectorstores using libraries like FAISS and OpenAI tools.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the Supabase 'created_at' column error.
- Enhanced the RAG system setup with improved data retrieval and organization strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Further fine-tuning of models with original text chunks versus embeddings.
- Continued exploration of metadata enrichment for semantic search.
