## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Supabase Database Management and Debugging

**🕒 01:15–02:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Supabase, API, Debugging, Database, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the management and debugging of Supabase databases by implementing structured approaches for storing text chunks, fetching table information, and resolving various API and database-related errors.

### Key Activities
- Developed a structured approach for storing and managing text chunks in Supabase, including database schema design and function implementation for data upload and retrieval.
- Implemented Python scripts to fetch tables from Supabase using both the `pg_catalog.pg_tables` and `information_schema.tables`.
- Debugged a `TypeError` related to API responses and resolved an `ImportError` with the Supabase Python SDK.
- Addressed `APIError` and database schema issues, ensuring proper API key verification and table permissions.
- Connected to Supabase using the Python client and troubleshooted database connection issues, focusing on PostgreSQL integration and API access.
- Analyzed errors involving PostgREST and PostgreSQL, offering solutions for API configuration and query corrections.

### Achievements
- Successfully managed and debugged multiple Supabase-related issues, improving database connectivity and API interactions.
- Enhanced understanding of Supabase's API and database management, leading to more efficient troubleshooting processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the implemented solutions in a production environment to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring of API and database performance to preemptively address potential issues.
