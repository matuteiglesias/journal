## 📅 2025-02-02 — Session: Enhanced RAG AI Capabilities and Integration

**🕒 21:40–22:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: RAG AI, metadata, vectorstore, integration, performance, Supabase  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the capabilities of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI by optimizing metadata management, vectorstore design, and context portability across domains. Additionally, it focused on analyzing and integrating various systems and strategies into the RAG pipeline.

### Key Activities
- Developed a strategic roadmap for improving RAG AI performance through metadata structuring and vectorstore optimization.
- Discussed performance optimizations and best practices for the RAG pipeline.
- Outlined best practices for context portability and multi-domain adaptability, including vector indices separation and hierarchical embeddings.
- Designed a hybrid storage and querying strategy using Supabase for efficient document retrieval and metadata management.
- Analyzed the CRAG system for potential integration into the RAG pipeline.
- Reviewed Pydantic models for data validation in Python, applicable to AI systems.
- Conducted file analysis for RAG system integration, focusing on retrieval, processing, and metadata.
- Examined the DocumentProcessor system for integration into the RAG pipeline, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
- Analyzed the HierarchicalRAG system for integration, suggesting the replacement of FAISS with Supabase for better efficiency.

### Achievements
- A comprehensive roadmap and set of best practices were established for enhancing RAG AI capabilities.
- Identified and analyzed several systems and strategies for integration into the RAG pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the suggested optimizations and integrations into the RAG pipeline.
- Further testing and validation of the proposed strategies and systems.
