**üïí 11:35‚Äì13:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: code modularization, thread safety, Python, file handling, lock handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance the modularity and concurrency handling of the existing Python codebase, focusing on file handling and thread safety.

### Key Activities
- **Code Modularization and Restructuring:** Proposed a refactored directory structure and modular approach to improve maintainability and integration with RAG pipelines.
- **Debounce Processing:** Provided options for defining the `debounce_processing` function in a file event handler class.
- **Lock Handling Improvements:** Analyzed and proposed improvements for lock handling in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Comprehensive Lock Handling Overview:** Explored lock handling in Python, covering threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and performance optimization.
- **FileEventHandler Initialization Fix:** Corrected the implementation of the `FileEventHandler` class.
- **File Processing Lock Usage Assessment:** Assessed and recommended improvements for lock usage in file processing workflows.
- **Refactoring for Modularity:** Refactored the `__main__` block to enhance modularity.
- **Supabase Sync Code Assessment:** Evaluated the Supabase sync code for robustness and performance improvements.
- **Directory Initialization for Processing Script:** Ensured robust directory management in the processing script.

### Achievements
- Enhanced code modularity and maintainability.
- Improved thread safety and concurrency management.
- Provided a comprehensive understanding of lock handling in Python.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed changes in the production environment.
- Further test the robustness of the new modular structure and concurrency handling.
