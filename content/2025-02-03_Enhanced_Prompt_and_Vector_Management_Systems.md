## 📅 2025-02-03 — Session: Enhanced Prompt and Vector Management Systems

**🕒 18:50–20:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: PromptManager, VectorStoreManager, AI Workflows, Debugging, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the management systems for prompts and vectors, focusing on improving efficiency, scalability, and integration within AI workflows.

### Key Activities
- Defined and outlined the responsibilities and API design for the `VectorStoreManager` to handle vector retrieval, storage, and indexing.
- Developed the `PromptManager` framework to manage AI prompts, including features for dynamic parameters, versioning, and customization.
- Integrated `PromptManager` into the RAG pipeline for improved AI workflow execution.
- Refactored `VectorStoreManager` to use a `VectorStore` class for better encapsulation and scalability.
- Merged the CRAG class into `VectorStoreManager` to enhance retrieval capabilities using FAISS.
- Debugged and fixed multiple errors related to prompt formatting and vector management, including `KeyError` and `AttributeError` issues.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined and partially implemented enhanced management systems for both prompts and vectors.
- Improved error handling and debugging processes for prompt and vector management.

### Pending Tasks
- Complete the full implementation of the enhanced `VectorStoreManager` and `PromptManager` systems.
- Further test and refine the integration of these systems into existing workflows.
