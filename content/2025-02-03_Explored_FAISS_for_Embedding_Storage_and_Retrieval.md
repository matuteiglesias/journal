## üìÖ 2025-02-03 ‚Äî Session: Explored FAISS for Embedding Storage and Retrieval

**üïí 16:30‚Äì17:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: FAISS, embeddings, installation, OpenAI, RAG, similarity search  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the use of FAISS for storing and retrieving embeddings, particularly in comparison to traditional methods like CSV/JSON and OpenAI tools.

### Key Activities
- **Storing Embeddings**: Discussed advantages of using FAISS over CSV/JSON, focusing on speed, efficiency, and scalability. Detailed steps for building and querying a FAISS index were provided.
- **Installing FAISS**: Outlined solutions for GLIBC incompatibilities during FAISS installation, including using Conda, Docker, and building from source.
- **Understanding FAISS**: Explored FAISS as a high-performance similarity search engine, its dependencies, and GPU acceleration support.
- **FAISS vs OpenAI Tools**: Compared FAISS and OpenAI tools for managing embeddings, highlighting FAISS's strengths in storage and retrieval.
- **Installation Confirmation**: Confirmed successful FAISS installation and provided a testing guide.
- **Choosing Tools**: Discussed use cases for FAISS, OpenAI RAG, or a hybrid approach in workflows.
- **Using OpenAI for RAG Systems**: Evaluated the feasibility of using OpenAI alone for RAG systems.

### Achievements
- Successfully installed FAISS and verified its functionality.
- Gained insights into the optimal use cases for FAISS and OpenAI tools in embedding management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of hybrid approaches combining FAISS and OpenAI tools for specific workflows.
