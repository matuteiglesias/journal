## 📅 2025-02-05 — Session: Unified Financial Data Processing and Visualization

**🕒 20:00–20:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: financial functions, Python, data visualization, automation, currency conversion  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the financial data processing and visualization pipeline by unifying and modularizing various functions.

### Key Activities
- **Unified Financial Functions**: Introduced `compute_transaction_series` to consolidate financial flows, improving scalability and maintainability.
- **Currency Conversion Integration**: Added currency conversion to the `load_sheet` function for consistent financial data preprocessing.
- **Financial Plotting Module**: Planned a modular function for financial plotting using Python and Matplotlib.
- **Standard Financial Plots**: Outlined a structured approach for generating thematic financial insights using `plot_series()`.
- **TypeError Handling**: Resolved a TypeError with Pandas PeriodIndex in Matplotlib by converting to Timestamp.
- **Household Ledger Automation**: Automated the analysis of household ledger data for enhanced reporting.

### Achievements
- Enhanced modularity in financial data processing and visualization.
- Improved data consistency through integrated currency conversion.
- Developed a plan for a unified plotting module.
- Resolved compatibility issues in data visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the planned unified plotting module for financial charts.
- Further test and refine the household ledger automation workflow.
