## 📅 2025-02-06 — Session: Enhanced Financial Ledger Data Processing Functions

**🕒 16:20–17:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, DataFrame, Finance, Data Processing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance and modularize functions for processing financial ledger data using Python and Pandas, focusing on filtering and time-series analysis.

### Key Activities
- Developed a Python function to extract rent-related records from a financial ledger DataFrame, improving code modularity and readability.
- Created the `get_from_ledger` function to filter a Pandas DataFrame based on specified criteria using predefined masks, with examples and component explanations.
- Updated the `get_from_ledger` function to streamline logic for better flexibility and maintainability.
- Enhanced the `compute_transaction_series` function for flexible ledger analysis, incorporating time-series data computation with cumulative sums and conflict-free column naming.
- Addressed the `SettingWithCopyWarning` in Pandas by ensuring modifications are made on a DataFrame copy, improving data processing reliability.

### Achievements
- Successfully modularized and improved the filtering logic for financial ledger data processing.
- Enhanced functions for better flexibility, maintainability, and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated functions in diverse scenarios to ensure robustness and accuracy.
