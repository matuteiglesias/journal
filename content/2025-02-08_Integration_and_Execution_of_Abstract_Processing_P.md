## 📅 2025-02-08 — Session: Integration and Execution of Abstract Processing Pipeline

**🕒 16:30–17:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: abstract processing, AI, pipeline, error handling, state management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to integrate and execute an abstract processing pipeline using AI-driven tools for efficient research abstract management.

### Key Activities
- Integrated abstract processing agents into the workflow, adapting existing classes and functions for abstract handling.
- Implemented the `AbstractManager` class for storing and retrieving abstracts in JSON format, ensuring no duplicates.
- Developed the `AbstractsState` class for managing the state of abstracts through processing stages.
- Adapted the `ChunkHandler` to `AbstractProcessor` for DOI-based abstract processing.
- Updated schemas and function mappings for AI agents, including the Abstract Reader and Screening Agent.
- Implemented the execution pipeline for the Abstract Reader and Screening Agent.
- Addressed network issues with CrossRef API by using a mock dataset.
- Updated `AbstractsState` and `AbstractManager` for AI output handling.
- Revised the `process_abstracts` function for improved error handling and state management.
- Fixed errors related to `ValidationError` and `TypeError` in class implementations.

### Achievements
- Successfully executed a mock abstract processing and screening workflow.
- Established a comprehensive pipeline for fetching, processing, and displaying research abstracts.

### Pending Tasks
- Validate and integrate the updated schemas and function mappings for AI agents.
- Further refine error handling mechanisms for robust pipeline execution.
