**🕒 15:20–16:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: API, abstracts, AI, data pipeline, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to optimize the retrieval and analysis of research abstracts using various APIs and AI agents.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed a guide on retrieving abstracts using CrossRef, PubMed, and Semantic Scholar APIs.
- Compared CrossRef Metadata API and Semantic Scholar API to select the best option for scholarly metadata retrieval.
- Planned a dual-layer pipeline for literature screening in economics using CrossRef and Semantic Scholar.
- Troubleshot network issues with the CrossRef API.
- Updated the research paper processing pipeline for data ingestion and abstract screening.
- Reflected on the role of abstracts in research production and proposed a hybrid approach for screening.
- Developed AI agent instructions for optimal abstract analysis and insights on priming techniques for LLMs.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive workflow for abstract retrieval and integration.
- Enhanced AI agent instructions for abstract analysis, focusing on clarity, specificity, and completeness.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the AI agent prompts for improved abstract evaluation.
- Implement the dual-layer pipeline for broader academic data gathering.

### Outcome
The session resulted in a refined approach to abstract retrieval and analysis, leveraging both API capabilities and AI enhancements.
