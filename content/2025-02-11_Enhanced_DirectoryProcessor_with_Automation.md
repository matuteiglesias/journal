**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the `DirectoryProcessor` class by integrating new functionalities for file indexing, metadata extraction, and automation through a watcher system.

### Key Activities
- Integrated the `process_file_metadata()` function into the `index_files()` method, improving file indexing and metadata extraction.
- Enhanced the `index_files()` function to support batch-oriented text extraction and UUID assignment.
- Conducted a compatibility analysis of the `DirectoryProcessor` with older code, identifying missing functionalities and proposing fixes.
- Updated the `chunk_files()` method with improvements from the `process_chunks()` function.
- Implemented an automated directory monitoring system using the `watchdog` library for continuous file indexing and chunking.
- Integrated the watcher system into the `DirectoryProcessor` framework for real-time file processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated metadata processing into file indexing.
- Enhanced batch processing capabilities and error handling in the `DirectoryProcessor`.
- Established an automated system for real-time file monitoring and processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the watcher system for different directory structures.
- Documentation updates for the new features and integrations.
