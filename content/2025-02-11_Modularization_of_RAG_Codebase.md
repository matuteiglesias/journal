### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to modularize the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) codebase to improve scalability and maintainability.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed codebase fragmentation and proposed refactoring strategies.
- Created a clean, modular RAG pipeline by organizing code into logical modules.
- Initialized necessary Python files in the `v2/` directory for AI processing, data indexing, and more.
- Outlined a modular organization plan for the `v2/` directory, detailing specific categories and commands for file creation.
- Migrated remaining components in the RAG codebase, including specific functions and classes.
- Finalized steps for codebase modularization, detailing the functions and classes that need to be moved to specific files.

### Achievements
- Successfully structured the codebase into the `v2/` directory, enhancing organization and accessibility.
- Completed migration of components, ensuring all functions and classes are in their designated locations.

### Pending Tasks
- Conduct a thorough review of the new structure to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
- Optimize any identified bottlenecks in the new modular setup.
