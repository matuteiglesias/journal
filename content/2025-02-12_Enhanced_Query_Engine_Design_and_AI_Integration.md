**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the design and functionality of a Query Engine and integrate it with AI-driven models and workflows.

### Key Activities
- Designed a comprehensive Query Engine supporting semantic and hybrid search, metadata filtering, and domain-specific retrieval.
- Developed a hybrid model integrating functional and AI action queries for improved data retrieval.
- Outlined an AI action wrapper for integrating structured query retrieval with AI processing tasks.
- Refactored the AIActionWrapper class for enhanced text processing capabilities.
- Explored LangGraph state persistence and checkpointing strategies.
- Implemented scaling strategies for AI execution pipelines to manage multiple workflows.
- Developed methods for persisting compiled LangGraph workflows.
- Differentiated between `invoke()` and `stream()` methods in LangGraph workflows.
- Planned initial workflows for a hybrid invoke/stream system.
- Refactored Python functions for unified AI function execution and enhanced input handling.
- Integrated VectorStoreManager with the AI processing pipeline for seamless text retrieval and processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and planned enhancements for a Query Engine and AI integration.
- Implemented and refactored AI functionalities for improved text processing and workflow management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced Query Engine and AI models.
- Continued development of workflows for the hybrid invoke/stream system.
