## 📅 2025-02-17 — Session: Email Data Processing and Analysis

**🕒 11:55–12:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: email analysis, data cleaning, Python, NetworkX, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the processing and analysis of email data using Python, focusing on timestamp handling and network analysis.

### Key Activities
- Developed one-liner computations using Pandas and NetworkX for email network analysis, including classifying communication types and identifying active users.
- Parsed and standardized email date formats to UTC-3 using a Python script.
- Streamlined DataFrame date cleaning in Python, improving readability and performance.
- Fixed issues with naive datetime objects by converting them to timezone-aware objects in Argentina local time.
- Resolved a NameError related to the missing `pytz` library by adding the necessary import.
- Handled invalid email date formats using `dateutil.parser` for robust timestamp parsing.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented solutions for email data cleaning and analysis, improving data quality and analytical capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented scripts in different datasets.
- Integration of these solutions into a larger data processing pipeline.
