## 📅 2025-02-21 — Session: Reset and Rerun FAISS Pipeline

**🕒 18:30–19:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: FAISS, data pipeline, embedding, machine learning, search algorithms  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to reset and rerun the FAISS pipeline to ensure clean data processing and prevent duplicate embeddings.

### Key Activities
- Executed a full reset of the FAISS pipeline, including purging old data and verifying deletions.
- Restarted the embedding process and confirmed the integrity of the FAISS index.
- Analyzed FAISS search results for 'THE STREAM DATA MODEL', identifying strengths and weaknesses in the search algorithm.

### Achievements
- Successfully reset and reran the FAISS pipeline, ensuring clean and accurate data processing.
- Identified areas for improvement in FAISS search results, particularly in ranking relevant results.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine FAISS search algorithms to improve ranking effectiveness.
- Continue monitoring the integrity of the FAISS index post-reset.
