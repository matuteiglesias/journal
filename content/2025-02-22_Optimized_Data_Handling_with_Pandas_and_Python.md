**üïí 19:15‚Äì19:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Pandas, Optimization, Python, Data Handling, TextManager  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance the efficiency and structure of data handling processes using Pandas and Python.

### Key Activities
- **Optimized Pandas Query for Chunk Metadata:** Improved the approach to loading and querying chunk metadata, focusing on efficiency.
- **Optimized Code for Creating Chunk List:** Developed an optimized code snippet for generating a list of dictionaries from chunk IDs.
- **Load Raw Text Chunks Function:** Implemented a function to load raw text chunks from disk with optimizations for metadata access and error handling.
- **Analysis of Text Retrieval Functions:** Compared two text retrieval functions to highlight use cases and optimization opportunities.
- **Standardization Goals for TextManager Class:** Outlined goals for standardizing the `TextManager` class, focusing on method signatures and file operations.
- **Analysis of `get_chunks_from_paths()` Function:** Analyzed the function for efficiency improvements and design coherence.
- **Efficient Row Filtering in Pandas DataFrames:** Explored methods for filtering DataFrame rows using NumPy for performance optimization.

### Achievements
- Enhanced data handling processes with optimized code snippets and functions.
- Identified and outlined standardization and refactoring goals for the `TextManager` class.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refactoring of the `TextManager` class to implement the outlined standardization goals.
- Continued analysis and optimization of text retrieval functions for improved performance.
