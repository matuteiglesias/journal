### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to refactor the AI and text processing architecture to improve modularity, scalability, and clarity in class responsibilities.

### Key Activities
- Refactored `AIProcessor` and `TextProcessor` classes to separate concerns and define distinct roles.
- Proposed restructuring of classes for modular AI processing, emphasizing separation of concerns and scalability.
- Refactored `AICaller` and `AIProcessor` classes to enhance separation of concerns and implement prompt wrappers as decorators.
- Enhanced modularity by moving AI functions out of the `AIProcessor` class.
- Implemented dynamic function lookup in `AIProcessor` to enhance modularity and maintainability.
- Optimized data structure and processing logic for AI text retrieval using dictionaries for efficient lookups.
- Transformed `retrieved_texts` from a list of dictionaries to a dictionary format for data integrity and efficient lookups.
- Developed a reusable semantic search function using FAISS for flexible querying and retrieval.
- Enhanced multi-chunk AI processing by passing full chunk metadata to AI wrapper functions.
- Updated functions to handle full chunk objects and associated metadata.

### Achievements
- Improved the modularity and scalability of the AI processing architecture.
- Enhanced the separation of concerns and clarity in class responsibilities.
- Developed reusable and efficient semantic search functions.
- Optimized data structures for better processing logic and efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further enhancements to the modular AI processing system for improved flexibility and scalability.
- Continue debugging and refining the `chunks_info` input for AI function execution.
