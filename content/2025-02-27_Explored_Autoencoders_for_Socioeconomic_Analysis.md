## 📅 2025-02-27 — Session: Explored Autoencoders for Socioeconomic Analysis

**🕒 01:30–02:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: autoencoders, socioeconomic, latent variables, log-likelihood, data analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the use of autoencoders in socioeconomic modeling, focusing on understanding latent structures and their implications for data analysis.

### Key Activities
- Investigated the connection between sparse autoencoders and latent variables in the context of census data.
- Explored the relationship between autoencoders and probabilistic generative models, focusing on log-likelihood decomposition.
- Discussed the application of log-likelihood decomposition in estimating socioeconomic statistics like the Gini index.
- Outlined a benchmarking plan for evaluating socioeconomic trait reconstruction from learned representations.
- Detailed methods for integrating census and survey data in autoencoder training for income prediction.

### Achievements
- Developed insights into the application of autoencoders for socioeconomic data analysis.
- Formulated a comprehensive benchmarking framework for model evaluation.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the outlined benchmarking strategies and integrate them into the current data analysis workflows.
