## 📅 2025-02-28 — Session: PostgreSQL Database Management and JSON Import

**🕒 20:35–21:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: PostgreSQL, Database Management, JSON Import, Python, SQL  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to manage a PostgreSQL database efficiently by establishing connections, creating tables, and importing JSON data.

### Key Activities
- Discussed correct methods for connecting to PostgreSQL using various tools like `psql`, `pgcli`, Python's `psycopg2`, DBeaver, and PGAdmin.
- Introduced basic `psql` commands and instructions for importing JSON email data.
- Provided an overview of existing databases and tables, highlighting the need to create a new 'emails' table and clean up unused ones.
- Outlined steps for creating a table in PostgreSQL and importing JSON data using both backup commands and Python scripts.
- Offered a sample JSON structure for testing email data import processes.
- Created a flexible SQL table using JSONB for email storage.
- Detailed steps to forcefully drop the 'emails' table in both Supabase and PostgreSQL, addressing constraints and security issues.
- Provided a Python script for batch inserting JSON data into PostgreSQL and discussed the benefits of using Python over SQL's `COPY` command.
- Explained installation methods for `psycopg2` and alternatives like `asyncpg`.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive understanding of PostgreSQL database management and JSON data import processes.
- Successfully created and managed database tables for email data storage.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and verification of email data import processes using the provided JSON structure.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of database operations.
