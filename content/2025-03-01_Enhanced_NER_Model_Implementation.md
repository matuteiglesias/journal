## 📅 2025-03-01 — Session: Enhanced NER Model Implementation

**🕒 04:10–04:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: NER, Transformers, Machine Learning, Python, Data Processing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to optimize Named Entity Recognition (NER) processes using Transformer models, focusing on improving speed and accuracy.

### Key Activities
- Selected and recommended smaller Transformer models like `dbmdz/bert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english` for NER tasks prioritizing speed and accuracy.
- Addressed subword tokenization issues impacting entity recognition, providing solutions for merging subwords and mapping unclear labels to meaningful entity types.
- Implemented code fixes to clean NER outputs by correcting unwanted labels and incorrect entity groupings.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and applied a suitable Transformer model for fast NER applications.
- Developed and implemented code solutions to improve NER output quality.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the implemented solutions in diverse datasets to ensure robustness and reliability.
