**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve data deduplication accuracy and address issues in data processing scripts.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed strategies to enhance Dedupe's accuracy by focusing on feature improvements and clustering sensitivity.
- Fixed a TypeError in Dedupe 3.0 by correcting interaction variable definitions.
- Provided insights on optimizing a data processing script to address grouping issues.
- Consolidated sparse data by merging records based on unique Person_ID.
- Cleaned and consolidated multiple 'alumnos' CSV files into a single dataset using Python and pandas.

### Achievements
- Successfully improved the accuracy of Dedupe by implementing better training practices and feature adjustments.
- Resolved interaction variable errors in Dedupe 3.0, ensuring smoother data processing.
- Enhanced data grouping accuracy by addressing over-grouping and under-grouping issues.
- Efficiently consolidated sparse data and multiple CSV files into cleaned datasets.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of deduplication strategies to ensure robustness across different datasets.
