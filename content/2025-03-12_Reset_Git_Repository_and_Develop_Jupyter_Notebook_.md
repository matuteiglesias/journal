### Session Goal
The aim of this session was twofold: to reset a Git repository to a clean state and to develop a structured framework for generating educational Jupyter Notebooks.

### Key Activities
- **Git Repository Reset**: Successfully reset the Git repository, removing unwanted commits and files to achieve a stable state.
- **Jupyter Notebook Framework**: Developed a systematic approach for creating structured Jupyter Notebooks. This included:
  - Outlining a workflow for integrating problem statements, code snippets, and learning resources.
  - Proposing a Python script for automating notebook generation from datasets.
  - Designing a framework for exercise creation, focusing on problem definition and AI guidance.
  - Creating guides for exercise design, conventions, and style in Python notebooks.
  - Establishing a formal structure for data science education notebooks.

### Achievements
- A clean and stable Git repository was achieved.
- A comprehensive framework for educational Jupyter Notebooks was developed, including templates and guides.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed Python script for automating notebook generation.
- Further refine the exercise design framework based on feedback.
