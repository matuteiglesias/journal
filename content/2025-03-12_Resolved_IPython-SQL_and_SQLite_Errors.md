### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to address and resolve several errors encountered while using IPython-SQL with SQLite databases in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Key Activities
- **Fixed 'No module named sql' Error**: Installed the `ipython-sql` package to resolve the module error.
- **Resolved Database Connection Errors**: Provided solutions for missing environment variables in database connections for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
- **Connected Python SQLite with IPython-SQL**: Explained how to share a connection between Python's sqlite3 and IPython-SQL for effective use of in-memory SQLite databases.
- **Connected IPython-SQL to SQLite in Memory**: Outlined the correct method to connect IPython-SQL to an SQLite in-memory database, addressing common mistakes.
- **Resolved 'No such table: empleados' Error**: Explained and provided solutions for the 'No such table: empleados' error by binding SQLAlchemy and IPython-SQL to the same SQLite connection and using a temporary file-based SQLite database.
- **Fixed KeyError 'DEFAULT' in IPython-SQL**: Addressed the KeyError 'DEFAULT' by setting a valid PrettyTable style before executing SQL queries.

### Achievements
Successfully resolved multiple errors related to IPython-SQL and SQLite, ensuring smoother database operations in Jupyter Notebooks.
