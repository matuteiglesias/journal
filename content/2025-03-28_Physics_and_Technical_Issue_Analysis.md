### Session Goal
The session aimed to clarify and verify various physics concepts, particularly thin-film interference, and address technical issues related to web development and account restrictions.

### Key Activities
- Verified phase shift and formula for thin-film interference.
- Assessed prompt validity and model response for Thorium-229.
- Corrected calculation errors in Chain of Thought regarding mass after half-lives.
- Verified decay calculations for Thorium-229 and compared model responses with numpy calculations.
- Analyzed network and resource loading errors, including CORS and 403 errors.
- Provided troubleshooting steps for Firefox console errors and discussed shadowbans and account restrictions.
- Developed templates for effective communication with support bots.

### Achievements
- Clarified and corrected physics concepts and calculations.
- Identified and provided solutions for web development errors.
- Created communication templates for handling account restrictions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further investigation into the root causes of network errors and account restrictions may be needed.
