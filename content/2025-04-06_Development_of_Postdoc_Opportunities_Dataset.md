## 📅 2025-04-06 — Session: Development of Postdoc Opportunities Dataset

**🕒 17:25–17:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: postdoc, data scraping, automation, web crawling, LLM  
**📂 Project**: JobMarket  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to develop a dataset of 20–30 promising research institutions for postdoc positions. This involves URL extraction and webpage analysis to identify potential Principal Investigators (PIs) and opportunities, with an aim to automate the process for strategic intelligence.

### Key Activities
- **Building a Dataset for Postdoc Opportunities:** Initiated the compilation of a dataset focusing on research institutions.
- **Institutional Navigation Pipeline Update:** Enhanced the institutional navigation pipeline to identify key elements on academic websites.
- **Structured Dataset Development:** Planned the creation of a structured dataset by scraping data from target institutions' websites using an LLM for parsing.
- **Structured Intelligence Pipeline:** Developed a detailed approach for a structured intelligence pipeline for postdoc targeting.
- **Multi-Stage Intelligence Architecture:** Outlined a multi-stage pipeline for discovering and filtering postdoc research opportunities.
- **Setup and Automation:** Estimated setup and automation time for the data scraping pipeline.
- **Directory Layout:** Designed a directory layout for parsing institution landing pages and generating leads.
- **Compact Research Opportunity Module:** Developed a module to crawl institutional pages and export clean outputs.
- **Refined Submodule Layout:** Structured a layout for a modular submodule in a script directory.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive plan for developing a dataset of postdoc opportunities.
- Enhanced the navigation and scraping pipelines to improve data extraction and classification.

### Pending Tasks
- Implementation of the planned pipelines and modules.
- Testing and validation of the scraping and data parsing processes.
