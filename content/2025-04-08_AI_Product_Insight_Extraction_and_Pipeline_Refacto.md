**üïí 15:50‚Äì16:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI, Product Management, Pipeline, Python, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on enhancing AI-driven product management tools and refining data processing pipelines.

### Key Activities
- Developed the `ai_extract_product_insights` function to asynchronously extract structured product insights from various sources using OpenAI's GPT model.
- Outlined a JSON schema for product discovery, facilitating AI extraction from a product manager's perspective.
- Conducted a diagnostic analysis of existing code, proposing refactoring for improved modularity and maintainability.
- Refactored Python scripts to enhance pipeline clarity, modularity, and robustness.
- Integrated file management improvements, including options for generating and updating `file_lists.txt` using Bash or Python.
- Improved file loading and processing code for better scalability and functionality.
- Emulated Bash commands in Python for file management tasks.
- Implemented parsing techniques for fixed-width formatted data using Pandas.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a new AI function for product insights extraction.
- Enhanced the modularity and maintainability of data processing pipelines.
- Improved file management and data parsing techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the refactored pipeline and new AI functions.
- Explore additional improvements in data persistence and output layers.
