## 📅 2025-04-12 — Session: Enhanced Fullstack App with Modular Architecture

**🕒 23:15–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: fullstack, FastAPI, modular, automation, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to upgrade a fullstack application by integrating template features, finalizing backend structures, and migrating to a modular architecture.

### Key Activities
- Upgraded the fullstack app by integrating useful starter files from a template to enhance developer experience and prevent common issues.
- Finalized the FastAPI backend structure by organizing and replacing files, including `main.py`, `router.py`, and `file_scan.py`.
- Migrated the fullstack application to a modular architecture using the ai-dataops-template, providing a migration strategy and highlighting the benefits.
- Developed a bash script for setting up the fullstack app, including directory structure and tooling installation.
- Created a surgical copy plan for merging files from a sandbox environment into the new fullstack setup.
- Fixed a `ModuleNotFoundError` in the Python app by correcting import paths and following best practices.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated template features and finalized the backend structure.
- Completed the migration to a modular architecture, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- Developed automation scripts for setup and file management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the merged fullstack application to ensure stability and performance.
- Continuous monitoring for any additional integration issues.
