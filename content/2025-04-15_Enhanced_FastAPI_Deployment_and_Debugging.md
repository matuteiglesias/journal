**üïí 14:05‚Äì15:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: FastAPI, Docker, Deployment, Debugging, API, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the deployment and debugging processes for a FastAPI application, focusing on Docker deployment, input handling, and API connectivity.

### Key Activities
- Created a Dockerfile for setting up a Python 3.11 environment for application deployment.
- Provided detailed instructions for launching a FastAPI service in a Docker container, including necessary scripts and configurations.
- Developed a phased strategy for fullstack AI product development, emphasizing efficiency and bug minimization.
- Finalized a minimal FastAPI backend for Phase 2, including code customizations and testing instructions.
- Addressed a critical edge case in flow input handling, ensuring correct data loading from YAML files.
- Analyzed differences between CLI and API flow execution, providing troubleshooting steps.
- Merged `run()` methods for `PromptBlock`, enhancing debugging and error handling.
- Diagnosed and proposed fixes for FastAPI POST request errors and connection issues with OpenAI's API.
- Validated startup logs and suggested next steps for API connectivity and system validations.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and tested a Docker deployment setup for a FastAPI application.
- Improved input handling and error diagnostics for FastAPI services.
- Enhanced debugging strategies for both CLI and API executions.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement suggested next steps from startup log validation, including model list checks and health check routes.
