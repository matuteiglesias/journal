**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance AI orchestration capabilities by developing modular architectures and tools, specifically focusing on `fp` commands, PromptFlow chat flows, and blockflows.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a battle-readiness sweep for `fp` commands, detailing their expected behavior and common failure modes.
- Delivered a masterclass on building chat flows with PromptFlow, covering flow structure, inputs/outputs, and examples.
- Planned a modular architecture for PromptFlow YAMLs to create reusable AI components and structured testing.
- Outlined a visionary approach to modular, traceable AI blockflows, emphasizing strategic growth hacks.
- Developed a CLI tool for testing flow blocks within the PromptFlow system.
- Drafted a Python script for running specific blocks from a YAML flow file using the Typer library.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive understanding of `fp` commands and their orchestration.
- Created a foundational plan for modular AI orchestration using PromptFlow.
- Developed tools and scripts to facilitate testing and development of AI workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the CLI tool and Python script.
- Implementation of modular blockflows in a live environment.
