**üïí 12:15‚Äì13:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, Error Resolution, Python, Automation, Testing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve various errors encountered in the PromptFlow environment and to enhance the execution and testing framework for PromptFlow projects.

### Key Activities
- **Fixed AttributeError**: Replaced incorrect method calls in the `ProxyFactory` class with the correct ones, ensuring smooth execution.
- **Designed Execution Method**: Developed a robust method for executing PromptFlow projects, focusing on modular execution and context handling.
- **Debugged File Path Issues**: Diagnosed and resolved file path errors in Python scripts by properly managing absolute and relative paths.
- **Resolved FileNotFoundError**: Addressed the root cause of a `FileNotFoundError` by correctly setting the working directory and flow file path in PromptFlow.
- **Fixed TypeError**: Analyzed and resolved a `TypeError` in the `exec_line_async` method by adjusting parameters for correct node execution.
- **Implemented Testing Flow**: Successfully implemented a single-node testing flow, allowing for modular block testing and validation.
- **Onboarded Block Builder Agent**: Focused on creating modular YAML PromptFlow blocks that are reusable and testable.
- **Developed Onboarding Plan**: Outlined an onboarding plan for a PromptFlow block developer, including guidelines and best practices.
- **Reviewed Master Flow Schema**: Provided an overview of the PromptFlow master flow schema, detailing DAG-style and Flex-style flows.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple errors in PromptFlow, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the execution framework.
- Established a foundation for modular and testable PromptFlow block development.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the onboarding process for new PromptFlow developers.
- Continuous improvement of the PromptFlow execution and testing methodologies.
