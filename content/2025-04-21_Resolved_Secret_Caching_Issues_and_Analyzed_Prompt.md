### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve secret caching issues in Promptflow, analyze past run logs, and ensure proper configuration for OpenAI API integration.

### Key Activities
- **Resolved Secret Caching Issues**: Identified and addressed the root cause of secret caching issues in Promptflow by recreating connections with new API keys and deleting old caches.
- **Analyzed Past Run Logs**: Provided a step-by-step guide on accessing and inspecting past run logs in PromptFlow using CLI commands.
- **Analyzed Chat Async Stream Results**: Outlined steps to view output results and analyze detailed outcomes using a local web trace viewer.
- **Battle-Tested Basic Chat Flow**: Utilized a checklist to validate and iterate over the Basic Chat flow, ensuring readiness for launch.
- **Fixed API Configuration**: Corrected a Python script to use OpenAI's API configuration instead of Azure's, providing a working example.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved caching issues and ensured that Promptflow connections are updated with new API keys.
- Gained insights from past run logs and chat async stream results.
- Validated and prepared the Basic Chat flow for deployment.
- Corrected API configuration issues in the Python script.
