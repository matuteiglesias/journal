**üïí 00:30‚Äì02:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: modular_design, AI_workflows, PromptFlow, Flowpower, automation, productivity  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the modularity and efficiency of AI-driven workflows, particularly focusing on flow configurations and prompt engineering within the PromptFlow framework.

### Key Activities
- Designed a modular function in Python for packaging flow configurations, including inputs, outputs, and design decisions.
- Troubleshot flow generation errors related to missing files and incorrect data mappings.
- Enhanced prompt rendering by integrating LLM calls post-rendering.
- Created templates for reusable `.prompty` files, emphasizing clarity and reusability.
- Outlined high-leverage workflows for AI scaling, focusing on productivity and alignment with personal goals.
- Explored strategic execution strategies for AI-driven workflows, including phases of development and high-value flow suggestions.
- Developed a consolidation plan for the Flowpower system, focusing on establishing a flow registry and integrating live examples.
- Identified strategic questions and automatable workflows to enhance productivity.

### Achievements
- Established a structured approach to modular design in flow configurations.
- Developed comprehensive templates and examples for `.prompty` files.
- Formulated strategic plans for scaling AI workflows and consolidating the Flowpower system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further implementation of identified high-leverage workflows.
- Execution of the consolidation plan for Flowpower.
