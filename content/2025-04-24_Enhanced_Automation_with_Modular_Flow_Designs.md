### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance automation processes by designing and implementing modular flow systems using various scripting and orchestration tools.

### Key Activities
- **Crafted JSONL Entries**: Developed JSONL entries for defining high-leverage meta-flows, focusing on automation and orchestration.
- **Standardized Input Schema**: Synchronized naming and structure across data processing flows, including defining a unified input schema and updating DAG configurations.
- **Designed Dynamic Folder Analysis**: Created a refined approach for folder-based flow design, enhancing modularity and reusability.
- **YAML DAG for README Generation**: Implemented a YAML-based DAG for generating README files using Azure ML's prompt flow.
- **Script Development**: Developed Python scripts for reading folder files and generating README.md files, ensuring robust file handling and clean formatting.
- **Output References Fix**: Addressed issues with output references in PromptFlow, ensuring explicit declaration of output keys.
- **README Audit and Update**: Conducted a thorough audit and update of README documentation to align with actual flow designs.
- **Self-Healing Packaging System**: Conceptualized a self-healing system for automating the detection and repair of flow inconsistencies.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented modular and dynamic flow designs that enhance automation efficiency.
- Improved documentation accuracy and usability for future users.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the self-healing packaging system to ensure robustness.
- Continued development of modular flow fixer pipeline using DAG architecture.
