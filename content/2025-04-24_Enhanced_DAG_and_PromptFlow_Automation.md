**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: DAG, PromptFlow, Python, LLM, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the automation capabilities of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and PromptFlow by implementing, debugging, and optimizing various scripts and templates.

### Key Activities
- Extended the DAG by implementing Steps 3-5, which included detecting inconsistencies, rendering fix instructions, and generating fixes using an LLM.
- Implemented the final node of the DAG to write generated fixes with optional backup functionality.
- Developed Python scripts to read flow folder files and extract variables for consistency checks.
- Debugged and fixed errors in DAG node references and PromptFlow configurations.
- Updated the `extract_variables` function to improve variable extraction and remove unused inputs.
- Enhanced inconsistency detection in Python tools and modified the LLM wrapper for structured JSON output.
- Implemented OpenAI Function Calling in the `llm_wrapper.py` script for better error handling and structured outputs.
- Created a schema blueprint for LLM function calls and a checklist for debugging and flow stabilization.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and debugged various components of the DAG and PromptFlow.
- Improved the consistency and reliability of variable management and error handling.
- Enhanced the modularity and precision of templates and scripts used in PromptFlow.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented changes to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of the DAG and PromptFlow processes.
