## 📅 2025-04-27 — Session: AI Architecture and Agent Development

**🕒 02:35–03:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: AI Architecture, LLMAdapter, Jinja2, Email Processing, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and develop AI architecture components and enhance existing agents with modular and scalable solutions.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed AI OS-level architecture components, focusing on Router Strategies, LLMAdapter, and BaseScheduler.
- Integrated `alive.py` with LLMAdapter, discussing compatibility and integration strategies.
- Designed a router dictionary for automated email processing using an Email Triager Agent.
- Implemented TaskProcessorAgent and EventProcessorAgent for enriching email data and integrating with calendar systems.
- Developed Jinja2 templates for dynamic prompt rendering in LLM calls, enhancing the TaskProcessorAgent and JobPostingProcessorAgent.

### Achievements
- Established a framework for scalable AI architecture components.
- Enhanced email processing agents with modular event processing functions.
- Upgraded agents with Jinja2 templates for improved prompt engineering.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the integrated systems and templates.
- Explore additional use cases for the Jinja2 templates in other AI agents.
