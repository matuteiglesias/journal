### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug various issues related to AI agents and integrate them with a Gradio UI for enhanced user interaction.

### Key Activities
- **Tool Registration Fix**: Addressed a 'Tool not found' error by registering a custom tool in the local registry.
- **Debugging Academic and Language Tutor Agents**: Resolved tool calling errors, undefined variables, and unhandled exceptions in the agents.
- **Python Debugging**: Utilized `pdb` for debugging Python scripts, focusing on tool and variable errors.
- **Package Management**: Fixed ImportError and version incompatibility issues with the `autogen` package.
- **Gradio UI Debugging**: Addressed rendering issues and fixed `NameError` by importing necessary modules.
- **Gradio Integration**: Implemented an interactive Gradio interface for Tech Support Agent, ensuring proper state management and user-driven workflows.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and resolved multiple issues across AI agents and Python scripts.
- Integrated a functional Gradio UI with a Tech Support Agent, allowing for improved user interaction and workflow execution.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refactoring of the Gradio UI to optimize LLM integration and execution flow.
