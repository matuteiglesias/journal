### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to validate and enhance PromptFlow pipelines for semantic analysis of assistant chat logs, focusing on metadata tagging and automation.

### Key Activities
- **Validation of PromptFlow Pipeline**: Conducted a validation process for a PromptFlow pipeline that semantically analyzes chat logs.
- **Setup Guide Creation**: Developed a comprehensive guide for setting up new semantic pipelines, including folder structure, YAML configurations, and run commands.
- **Periodic Processing Automation**: Transitioned from manual runs to a production-grade periodic processing loop using PromptFlow, with plans for centralized data aggregation.
- **Daily Message Export Script**: Implemented a Python script to extract daily subsets of messages and save them as JSONL files.
- **Run Folder Automation**: Planned a strategy to automate the identification of run folders for daily inputs in PromptFlow.
- **Output Appending Method**: Provided a method to append outputs to a `results.jsonl` file, ensuring PromptFlow's normal operation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Developed code to filter out null-structured JSON entries, ensuring meaningful data processing.
- **Unicode Handling**: Addressed JSON-escaped Unicode issues, providing solutions for handling accented characters.

### Achievements
- Successfully validated and enhanced the PromptFlow pipelines.
- Created reusable guides and scripts to facilitate automation and data management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the automated processing loop and run folder identification strategy.
