### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve various issues related to the `PersistentMemoryManager` and `ChromaDB` in the context of memory management and data embedding.

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed and fixed issues with the `PersistentMemoryManager`, focusing on `EMBED_LOG`, row_id parsing, and embedded logic.
- Addressed memory logging problems to ensure that newly embedded notes are correctly reflected.
- Confirmed pipeline functionality and suggested next steps for testing with new data.
- Resolved JSON parsing issues in Python scripts and improved timestamp storage methods.
- Enhanced log file processing for efficiency and modularity.
- Provided onboarding documentation and progress summary for the AIOS memory embedding pipeline.
- Refactored `embed_daily_logs.py` for portability and improved code consistency.
- Diagnosed and fixed issues with ChromaDB collections, including persistence and error handling.
- Implemented a two-tier memory system for AIOS, transitioning to long-term storage with `StorageManager`.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple errors and improved the robustness of the memory management system.
- Enhanced the modularity and portability of scripts, facilitating easier onboarding and maintenance.
- Established a clear path for transitioning to long-term storage solutions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing with new data inputs and re-embedding specific days.
- Consider switching to a more efficient logging system as suggested.
