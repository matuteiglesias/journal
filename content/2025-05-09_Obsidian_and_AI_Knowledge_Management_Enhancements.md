**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and implement enhancements for knowledge management using Obsidian and AI tools, focusing on Markdown processing, semantic routing, and automation.

### Key Activities
- Designed a modular Markdown patch engine to integrate AI-generated content into existing Markdown files without duplication.
- Proposed a semantic heading matching layer to resolve mismatches between AI-generated and existing headings.
- Outlined a two-stage semantic routing system for organizing knowledge in Markdown.
- Refined a knowledge base construction flow to enhance AI integration with minimal use.
- Developed methods for Obsidian-compatible local systems and installation guides for Linux.
- Set up Obsidian Publish for transforming local vaults into public websites.
- Enhanced Markdown practices for Obsidian Publish.
- Strategized a semi-automated knowledge curation approach leveraging AI.
- Integrated GPT screeners with Obsidian Publishing for structured annotation.
- Proposed a unified JSON schema for organizing AI-generated responses in Obsidian.
- Executed a plan for creating Obsidian-ready Markdown files from JSON responses.
- Improved AIflow for GPT chat review by chaining schema calls.
- Provided developer onboarding for automation scripts like `ingest.py` and `batch_promptflow_runner.py`.
- Explored options for modular PromptFlow structures and extended DAGs for dual schema support.
- Implemented a dynamic LLM wrapper using Pydantic for schema validation.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for integrating AI with Obsidian for knowledge management.
- Developed guides and templates for setting up and optimizing Obsidian and associated automation scripts.
- Enhanced the flexibility and modularity of PromptFlow and LLM wrappers.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the proposed systems and scripts.
- Continued development of modular and dynamic schema support in PromptFlow.
