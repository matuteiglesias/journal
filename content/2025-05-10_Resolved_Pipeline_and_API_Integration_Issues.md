## 📅 2025-05-10 — Session: Resolved Pipeline and API Integration Issues

**🕒 19:25–19:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: pipeline, error handling, OpenAI, API integration, debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


## Session Goal
The session aimed to address and resolve multiple technical issues related to pipeline crashes and API integration errors.

## Key Activities
- **Pipeline Error Handling**: Implemented a solution to prevent pipeline crashes due to missing files by normalizing the output of the `process_day()` function and handling unexpected statuses in the main loop.
- **OpenAI API Error Diagnosis**: Diagnosed an OpenAI API error in PromptFlow, providing actionable steps to resolve issues related to the 'parsed_message' function call.
- **OpenAI SDK Troubleshooting**: Identified potential causes for function call failures in the OpenAI SDK and outlined debugging strategies.
- **API Integration Debugging**: Addressed errors in API integration by ensuring the correct schema is loaded and debugging function call errors.

## Achievements
- Successfully implemented error handling in the pipeline to prevent crashes.
- Provided detailed diagnostics and solutions for OpenAI API and SDK issues.

## Pending Tasks
- Further monitoring of the pipeline to ensure stability.
- Continuous testing of the API integration to confirm error resolution.

## Additional Notes
- A culinary interlude included a recipe for creamy garlic white sauce penne, unrelated to the technical tasks but noted for personal interest.
