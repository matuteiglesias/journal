### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to integrate `pdoc` for automatic documentation generation in Python projects, addressing common issues and optimizing the workflow.

### Key Activities
- **Guided Setup**: Provided step-by-step instructions for setting up `pdoc` for automatic documentation generation, including installation and project structure organization.
- **Error Resolution**: Addressed common issues such as confusion between `pdoc` and `pdocs`, executable issues in virtual environments, and errors with local module recognition.
- **Security Measures**: Discussed how to protect sensitive information in documentation using `pdoc`.
- **Publication**: Offered guidance on publishing documentation online using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel, and implementing automatic translation.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated `pdoc` into the documentation workflow for Python projects.
- Resolved multiple errors related to documentation generation and ensured the correct setup of virtual environments and module imports.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced `pdoc` features for enhanced documentation customization and automation.
- Continuous monitoring for any new issues that may arise with updates or changes in project structure.
