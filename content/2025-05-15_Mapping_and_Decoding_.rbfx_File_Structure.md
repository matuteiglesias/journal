### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to map and decode the structure of `.rbfx` files using the REDATAM API, with a focus on understanding variable metadata and decoding binary data.

### Key Activities
- **Mapping .rbf[x] Structure:** Utilized the REDATAM API to access dictionary files and extract variable metadata necessary for decoding compressed binary data.
- **Analysis of `.rbfx` File Structure:** Conducted a detailed analysis of file structures, hypothesizing on variable hierarchies and their relationships with variable dictionaries.
- **Decoding Binary Segments:** Decoded a block of 5616 binary values, suggesting a concatenated segment structure within the `.rbfx` file.
- **Backtracking Strategy:** Implemented a structured backtracking approach to explore bit encoding, ensuring all combinations of bit partitions were evaluated.
- **Bit-Aligned Structure Analysis:** Identified main segments and residues in `.rbfx` files, suggesting steps for tabular data reconstruction.
- **Decoding 10-bit Integers:** Outlined the process for decoding 10-bit integers from `.rbfx` files, with steps for extraction and optional CSV saving.
- **Categorical Variable Analysis:** Analyzed histograms of decoded values, interpreting them as categorical variables and proposing further decoding steps.
- **Encoded Data Block Analysis:** Explored hypotheses about encoded values' structures, suggesting a bit-packed compound field hypothesis.
- **Redatam Development Reflection:** Reflected on the development and application of Redatam for Argentina's 2022 National Census.
- **Open Source Tools Discussion:** Discussed open-source tools for Redatam database interaction, highlighting projects like Open Redatam.
- **API Interface Layer Analysis:** Analyzed an open-source C++ interface layer for Redatam, discussing its functionality and limitations.

### Achievements
- Successfully mapped and decoded significant portions of `.rbfx` file structures.
- Developed strategies for further decoding and data reconstruction.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue with the automatic decoding of additional binary blocks.
- Test the bit-packed compound field hypothesis with further data.
- Explore more open-source tools for enhanced Redatam interaction.
