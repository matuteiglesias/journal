**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance document indexing in Haystack and improve web crawling processes.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed and compared different indexing methods in Haystack, focusing on `index_structured_docs` and `adapt_scraped_docs`.
- Conducted a systematic review to align JSON file structures with Haystack's expected semantics.
- Modified a Python script to save scraped web pages as Markdown files, organized by subdomain.
- Developed a function `index_saved_md_files()` to integrate Markdown files into the Haystack pipeline.
- Provided instructions for running a Streamlit app and resolving Python errors related to `Path.glob()` and Git `fetch` function.
- Implemented and debugged web crawling functions using the Spider API.
- Proposed a web exploration strategy for positioning in the academic ecosystem.

### Achievements
- Successfully aligned JSON structures for improved indexing.
- Enhanced web crawling scripts to save outputs in a more organized format.
- Developed a comprehensive strategy for web exploration and academic positioning.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new indexing and web crawling functions.
- Implementation of the proposed web exploration strategy.
