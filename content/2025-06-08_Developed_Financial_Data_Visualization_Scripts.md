### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to develop and refine Python scripts for visualizing financial data using various types of bar plots.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a Python script to generate a monthly bar plot with cumulative sums for the 'Credit PM_Cobros' variable.
- Created a stacked bar plot with cumulative sum lines for two financial indicators, enhancing the clarity of financial analysis.
- Developed a monthly bar plot for the 'Credit PM_Contribucion' dataset to visualize financial contributions over time.
- Designed a bar plot for 'Debit PM_Cambio' data, including annotations and cumulative sum lines for better financial insights.
- Constructed a stacked bar plot to visualize monthly outflows, with suggestions for customization.
- Improved color distinction in stacked bar plots for better category differentiation in governance reporting.
- Outlined a workflow for analyzing monthly net flux in financial data, including data loading, processing, and plotting.

### Achievements
- Successfully created multiple Python scripts for different financial data visualization needs, improving the ability to analyze and report on financial data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further customization of visualization scripts to meet specific reporting requirements.
- Integration of these scripts into a larger financial analysis toolkit.
