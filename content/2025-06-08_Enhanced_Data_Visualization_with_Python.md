### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to enhance data visualization techniques using Python, focusing on integrating various plots and ensuring consistency in presentation.

### Key Activities
- Integrated a custom line into an existing plot, ensuring alignment of date indices using Python and Matplotlib.
- Implemented a script to create a financial plot displaying monthly sums and a cumulative sum line.
- Developed visually appealing debt plots in pesos and USD using pandas and matplotlib.
- Proposed visualization techniques for service contributions using stacked bar and cumulative line plots.
- Standardized stacked barplots for contribution categories, emphasizing color coding and axis labeling.
- Verified file paths for script execution to troubleshoot issues with CSV file locations.
- Designed a quarterly financial plot for the 'gastos_FB' dataset, maintaining consistent styling.
- Refined data visualization for multiple financial variables, ensuring consistency in color-coding and cumulative line representation.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated multiple visualization techniques into existing workflows.
- Ensured consistency and standardization across various plot types.
- Addressed script execution issues related to file path verification.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of visualization scripts to ensure robustness.
- Consider generating a comprehensive report combining all visualizations.
