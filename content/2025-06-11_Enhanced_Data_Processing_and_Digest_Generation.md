## 📅 2025-06-11 — Session: Enhanced Data Processing and Digest Generation

**🕒 03:30–04:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Markdown, File Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data processing capabilities and improve the generation of markdown digest files from DataFrames.

### Key Activities
- Enhanced a Python function for topic-based grouping in DataFrames, ensuring data integrity and consistent subgroup identification.
- Revised strategy for DataFrame storage and markdown digest generation with improved file naming conventions.
- Updated `fetch_and_save_news()` function to assign unique IDs to articles, improving downstream processing.
- Proposed a new naming convention for CSV files generated during slicing, enhancing organization and traceability.
- Refined functions for saving digest files, incorporating improved naming conventions and metadata collection.
- Utilized `glob` to process CSV files and generate markdown digests with sanitized topics and structured output.
- Enhanced markdown digest composition by including metadata such as links, publication dates, and sources.
- Refined group splitting logic to ensure even distribution and consistent labeling of groups.
- Fixed grouping logic in digest files to prevent mixing articles from different topics.
- Updated date formatting in markdown files to include hours in 24-hour format.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented enhancements in data processing and digest generation, improving the overall workflow and output quality.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the new file naming conventions and digest generation process to ensure robustness and accuracy.
