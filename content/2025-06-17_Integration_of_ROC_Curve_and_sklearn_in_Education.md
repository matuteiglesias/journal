## üìÖ 2025-06-17 ‚Äî Session: Integration of ROC Curve and sklearn in Education

**üïí 06:00‚Äì07:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: ROC, sklearn, education, machine learning, AUC, classification  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the integration of ROC curve visualization with technical content from `roc_auc_score`, `roc_curve`, and `RocCurveDisplay` in `sklearn` to develop assessments that promote deep learning among students.

### Key Activities
- Explored the use of ROC curve and `RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions()` for educational purposes.
- Analyzed the functionality of `predict_proba()` in decision trees and logistic regression.
- Discussed the implicit threshold in decision trees.
- Proposed improvements to educational statements on AUC and thresholds.
- Clarified the independence of AUC from specific thresholds in classification models.
- Reviewed pedagogical strategies for reflecting on classification metrics.
- Analyzed limitations of decision trees with categorical variables.
- Clarified misconceptions about supervised and unsupervised learning.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of how ROC curves and related metrics can be used in educational contexts.
- Enhanced educational materials with improved clarity and pedagogical value.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the improved educational templates and strategies in actual teaching scenarios.
- Further explore the integration of these insights into the curriculum.
