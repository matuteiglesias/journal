**🕒 01:00–01:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: SQL, pandas, education, split-apply-combine, data analysis, exercise  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to create educational exercises and guides for implementing the split-apply-combine pattern in both SQL and pandas, as well as to design SQL exercises that enhance understanding of data manipulation and pipeline construction.

### Key Activities
- Developed a minimal toy example demonstrating the split-apply-combine pattern in SQL for calculating total revenue per product category.
- Created a step-by-step guide for implementing the split-apply-combine pattern in pandas.
- Designed a SQL exercise using Spanish-language variables to engage specific audiences, including a suggested toy table and SQL queries.
- Proposed an SQL exercise for purchase analysis to foster critical thinking and logical planning.
- Designed a pedagogical SQL exercise using a cheatsheet and a practical problem focused on pipeline design.
- Expanded an SQL cheatsheet with a detailed exercise incorporating a four-step pipeline using JOIN operations.
- Structured an activity to build a SQL pipeline that calculates total sales per category, integrating conceptual explanations and SQL queries.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed educational content and exercises for SQL and pandas focusing on the split-apply-combine pattern.
- Enhanced SQL teaching materials with exercises that promote critical thinking and practical application.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and refine the exercises for clarity and educational effectiveness.
- Translate SQL exercises into additional languages to broaden accessibility.
