### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to manage and process financial records spanning multiple years, from 2020 to 2023, in CSV format. The focus was on preparing these datasets for further analysis or consolidation into Excel.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed CSV data for financial records related to debts and payments for the years 2020 through 2023.

- Considered further data processing for earlier years (e.g., 2020) and consolidation into Excel.

### Achievements
- Successfully processed and prepared CSV datasets for each year from 2020 to 2023, ensuring they are ready for import or further analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Decide on the final format for these datasets (Excel or CSV) for long-term storage and analysis.
- Consider processing data from 2019 and earlier for comprehensive financial analysis.
