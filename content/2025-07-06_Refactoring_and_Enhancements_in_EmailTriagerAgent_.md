**üïí 17:00‚Äì18:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: EmailTriagerAgent, LLMToolAgent, Refactoring, Python, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to refactor and enhance the EmailTriagerAgent and LLMToolAgent classes to improve error handling, portability, and flexibility in execution environments.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing Hardcoded Schema Paths:** Resolved `FileNotFoundError` by improving path handling in the EmailTriagerAgent.
- **Configurable Project Root:** Made the project root configurable using environment variables for better portability.
- **Parameter Mismatch Fix:** Addressed parameter mismatch in `llm_call_tool_direct()` function.
- **Code Improvements:** Implemented critical improvements in EmailTriagerAgent and LLMToolAgent classes.
- **Dual Mode Support:** Redesigned `llm_call_tool_direct` to support both local and remote tool calls.
- **Agent Initialization Refactoring:** Refactored initialization and fallback behavior in agent classes.
- **Function Signature Update:** Updated `llm_call_tool_direct()` function signature to accept new arguments.
- **Fallback Response Fix:** Corrected fallback response structure in LLMResponse class.
- **Pydantic Model Access Correction:** Corrected access method for Pydantic models.
- **Email Triage Cap Implementation:** Implemented and updated email triage cap in orchestrator and EmailOrchestrator.
- **Method Naming Refactoring:** Planned method renaming in TriageStateManager class.
- **Email Triage System Analysis:** Analyzed bottlenecks and proposed improvements for email triage system.
- **Transition to Modular Service:** Outlined transition from notebook to modular email service.

### Achievements
- Enhanced error handling and configurability of agents.
- Improved code flexibility and portability.
- Established a foundation for future enhancements in email triage and processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of new configurations and fallback mechanisms.
- Implementation of proposed architectural shifts for modular email service.
