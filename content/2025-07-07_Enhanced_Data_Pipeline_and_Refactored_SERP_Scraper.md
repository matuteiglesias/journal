## 📅 2025-07-07 — Session: Enhanced Data Pipeline and Refactored SERP Scraper

**🕒 00:20–00:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data_pipeline, idempotency, logging, scraping, python, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance a data pipeline with idempotency and logging features, as well as refactor a SERP scraper to improve its functionality and robustness.

### Key Activities
- **Enhanced Data Pipeline**: Implemented improvements focusing on idempotency, persistence, and flexible execution modes. Detailed actions and code snippets were provided for implementation.
- **Refactored SERP Scraper**: Updated the Python script to process job titles and companies from a CSV file, retrieve search results via an API, and save the results in both JSONL and CSV formats. Added logging and metadata management.
- **Updated Features**: Enhanced the SERP scraper with idempotency, persistence, command-line operation, cron-readiness, and debugging options.
- **Robust Path Handling**: Developed a method for robust file path handling in Python scripts to ensure paths are resolved correctly relative to the project root.
- **Pandas 2.0 Adaptation**: Addressed the breaking change in pandas 2.0 regarding the removal of the `.append()` method, providing a code fix and optimization suggestions.
- **Job Search Pipeline Overview**: Reviewed the `01_serp_scraper.py` script's role in the job search pipeline, focusing on its functions, logging requirements, and improvement suggestions.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the data pipeline and refactored the SERP scraper.
- Improved robustness and flexibility of the scripts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced features in a production environment.
