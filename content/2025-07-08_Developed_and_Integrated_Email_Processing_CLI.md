**üïí 19:15‚Äì20:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: CLI, Email Processing, YAML, Python, Configuration  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve configuration issues and implement a command-line interface (CLI) for email processing, focusing on error resolution, command structure, and function integration.

### Key Activities
- Resolved a YAML syntax error related to improper formatting, ensuring correct configuration for email processing.
- Fixed a `gaierror` in the email fetcher configuration by correcting the YAML config for proper email server connectivity.
- Reviewed the email fetching process, ensuring successful execution and suggesting further steps for file inspection and triage process implementation.
- Outlined and implemented the structure and functionality of a CLI for email processing, including command flows and design considerations.
- Developed CLI functions for triaging and routing emails, integrating these with the `EmailOrchestrator` while maintaining backward compatibility.
- Implemented CLI commands for managing a daemon process, including starting, stopping, and displaying logs.
- Finalized the `triage_emails` CLI wrapper and implemented the `load_email_storage()` function for initializing the `EmailStorageManager`.
- Reviewed and refined the `TriageStateManager` design, fixing missing definitions and enhancing functionality.
- Migrated to a YAML-based configuration for the `EmailOrchestrator` to enhance flexibility and maintainability.

### Achievements
- Successful implementation of CLI commands and functions for email processing.
- Resolved configuration issues, ensuring smooth email fetching and processing.
- Enhanced the modularity and testability of the email routing logic.

### Pending Tasks
- Inspect stored files and implement the triage process.
- Test failure modes and refine the CLI command cheatsheet for user guidance.
