### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to refactor configuration paths in the system and evaluate the overall system design for productization.

### Key Activities
- Proposed a refactor of storage and triage paths in the configuration, providing code examples and diagnosing potential confusions.
- Implemented a function `load_paths(cfg)` to extract and normalize paths from a `config.yaml` file.
- Identified and corrected a misconfiguration in the `triager.gatekeeper.state_file` path.
- Conducted a final evaluation of the revised configuration structure, confirming coherence and well-formed nature of key elements.
- Assessed the functionality and performance of an email triage CLI.
- Strategically broke down the system design for productization, emphasizing actionable steps and the distinction between prototype and market-ready product.
- Analyzed user archetypes for the email triage tool, identifying motivations and potential friction points.
- Provided a crash course in modular CLI and UI architecture, focusing on `config.yaml` and `triage_logs.jsonl`.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored and evaluated configuration paths.
- Developed a clear understanding of system design requirements for productization.
- Improved user experience insights for the email triage tool.

### Pending Tasks
- Further improvements in email triage CLI functionality based on assessment insights.
- Continue refining user experience features for the email triage tool.
