### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to debug and standardize the architecture of a Streamlit app, `jobserp_explorer`, focusing on the integration and execution of PromptFlow tools.

### Key Activities
- **Debugging Streamlit with PromptFlow**: Addressed issues with PromptFlow integration in a Streamlit application, including environment checks and troubleshooting steps.
- **Tradeoffs of Installing `promptflow-tools`**: Evaluated the pros and cons of installing `promptflow-tools` directly in a Streamlit app, focusing on dependency management.
- **Version Management**: Recommended version pairing for `promptflow` and `promptflow-tools` to ensure compatibility and security.
- **Diagnosing Import Errors**: Developed a checklist for resolving import errors related to PromptFlow, including environment setup and code structure adjustments.
- **Architectural Recommendations**: Provided architectural options for a public demo of a Streamlit app using PromptFlow, emphasizing environment design.
- **Standardizing Architecture for `jobserp_explorer`**: Focused on creating a robust and portable design for the app, eliminating hardcoded assumptions.

### Achievements
- Identified and resolved several issues related to PromptFlow integration in Streamlit.
- Established a clean architecture and deployment strategy for `jobserp_explorer`.
- Improved understanding of dependency management and environment setup for Python applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new architecture and deployment strategy in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of dependency versions to align with best practices.
