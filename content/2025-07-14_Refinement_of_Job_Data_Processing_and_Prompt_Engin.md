### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to refine and enhance the job data processing scripts and templates used for web scraping, job posting analysis, and prompt engineering.

### Key Activities
- **Corrected Python Script for JSONL Export**: Fixed naming issues in the `05_export_jsonl_with_scraping.py` script to ensure proper functionality for exporting scraped data to JSONL format.
- **Analysis of Spider-Scraped Markdown Outcomes**: Evaluated the effectiveness of markdown scraping from job boards, identifying successes and areas for improvement.
- **Refined Jinja Prompt for Job Posting Analysis**: Improved a Jinja prompt for filtering low-quality data in job postings, focusing on evidence-based classification.
- **Refined Job Page Evaluation Prompt**: Developed a prompt for evaluating job-related webpages, emphasizing user value and structured analysis.
- **Job Posting Filtering and Screening Prompts**: Created structured prompts for filtering and screening job postings, including criteria for quality evaluation.
- **Update Flow YAML for Prompt Fields**: Updated input schema and prompt templates in YAML flow for clarity and accuracy.
- **Error Diagnosis for Input Schema Mismatch**: Analyzed and provided solutions for input schema mismatches in PromptFlow.
- **Resolving PromptFlow CLI Issues**: Addressed CLI connection issues with PromptFlow, providing troubleshooting steps.
- **Ensuring Determinism in Python Environment**: Improved environment setup practices for determinism in Python scripts using PromptFlow.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the robustness and accuracy of job data processing scripts and templates.
- Improved quality assessment and filtering mechanisms for job postings.
- Resolved technical issues related to PromptFlow CLI and input schema mismatches.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of updated scripts and prompts in a production environment to ensure stability and performance.
- Continuous refinement of job posting evaluation criteria based on feedback and new data insights.
