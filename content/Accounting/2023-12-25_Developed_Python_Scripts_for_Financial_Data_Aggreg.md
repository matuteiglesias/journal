## 📅 2023-12-25 — Session: Developed Python Scripts for Financial Data Aggregation

**🕒 14:40–16:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Data Aggregation, Financial Analysis, Error Handling  
**📂 Project**: Accounting  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for the aggregation and analysis of financial data, specifically focusing on expenses and debts.

### Key Activities
- **Data Formatting**: Defined a specific format for expense data to facilitate analysis and grouping using [[Python]].
- **Data Aggregation**: Developed [[Python]] scripts to group expenses by month and category, leveraging the [[Pandas]] library for [[data processing]].
- **Data Pivoting**: Utilized [[Pandas]] to pivot DataFrames, consolidating categories into columns and aggregating values by year and month.
- **Debt Accounting**: Proposed a system for recording family debts and payments, transforming payments into debts and establishing a detailed recording system.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Identified and addressed an error related to mismatched list lengths in a dictionary used for creating a [[Pandas]] DataFrame, ensuring uniformity before recalculating year-end balances.
- **System Planning**: Outlined a system for tracking financial flows related to car transactions, including purchases, sales, payments, and repairs.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and tested [[Python]] scripts for financial data aggregation and pivoting.
- Developed a comprehensive approach for handling family debts and payments.
- Resolved data validation errors to ensure accurate financial calculations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the [[Python]] scripts to handle additional edge cases in data aggregation.
- Implement the proposed system for tracking car-related financial transactions.
