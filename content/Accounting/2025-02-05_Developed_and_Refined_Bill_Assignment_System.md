**üìÇ Project**: Accounting  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the accounting system by developing and refining a bill assignment system using [[Python]]. The focus was on centralizing bill processing, standardizing functions, and improving data handling efficiency.

### Key Activities
- **Refinement of Accounting System Structure**: Centralized bill processing and standardized functions were planned to enhance efficiency.
- **Bill Assignment and Distribution**: Developed [[Python]] functions for assigning bills using round-robin and hash methods.
- **Module Creation**: Created `bill_assignment.py` and `debt_processing.py` modules for structured bill assignment and debt ledger processing.
- **Data Pipeline Streamlining**: Refined data processing pipeline for periodic bill assignment and abstraction of debt ledger filtering.
- **Debt Processing Functions**: Developed functions for filtering debt ledgers and exporting data to [[CSV]].
- **Bill Management System**: Integrated a complete bill assignment program with a structured flow from data loading to report generation.
- **Refactored Filtering Functions**: Improved custom filtering functions for debt ledger with robust error handling.
- **Dynamic Google Sheets Loader**: Created a function for dynamic data loading from Google Sheets into [[Pandas]].

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and refined a comprehensive bill assignment system.
- Enhanced data processing efficiency and modularity in the accounting system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinements and integrations can be made to the modules and functions as needed.
