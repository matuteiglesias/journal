## 📅 2025-07-05 — Session: Enhanced Financial Data Analysis with Pandas

**🕒 21:55–22:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data_Analysis, Financial_Data, Python, Pandas, Visualization  
**📂 Project**: Accounting  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine the processing and analysis of financial data files using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]], focusing on data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a diagnostic overview of financial data files to assess their status and outline next steps for aggregation.
- Developed a [[Python]] script to analyze monthly inflow and outflow from ledger files, employing [[Pandas]] for data loading, cleaning, and summarization.
- Addressed issues with non-datetime columns in DataFrames, providing solutions for date coercion and error handling.
- Resolved problems with timezone-aware datetimes by converting them to naive datetimes for consistent processing.
- Implemented robust date handling in [[Pandas]] to manage mixed-type date columns and prevent silent failures.
- Solved mixed timezone offsets in `posted_date` columns by converting timestamps to a uniform UTC format.
- Created bar chart visualizations for financial flows using [[Matplotlib]], including data pivoting and looping through files.

### Achievements
- Successfully cleaned and processed financial data, resolving datetime and timezone issues.
- Enhanced data visualization capabilities with clear financial flow representations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of data aggregation methods to improve efficiency.
- Exploration of additional visualization techniques for more insightful analysis.
