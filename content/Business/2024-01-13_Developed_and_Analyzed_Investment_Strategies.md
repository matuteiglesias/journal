### Session Goal
The aim of the session was to develop a comprehensive plan for investment strategies, including backtesting, risk management, and financial analysis using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Outlined a detailed investment [[strategy]] development plan, focusing on [[data analysis]], [[strategy]] formulation, backtesting, and risk management.
- Created a daily plan for setting up a backtesting environment using [[Python]] and Jupyter Notebook.
- Developed a financial ledger in Google Sheets for budgeting and financial tracking.
- Analyzed 5-year historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using [[Python]], including data fetching, visualization, and exponential model fitting.
- Implemented stock analysis using the `yfinance` library in [[Python]].
- Fitted an exponential model to stock data and plotted stock prices with volume information.
- Corrected errors in [[Pandas]] for [[data visualization]] and resampling.
- Calculated and visualized the 'Opportunity' ratio for stock prices.
- Compiled ticker symbols from Yahoo Finance and retrieved S&P 500 ticker symbols using [[Python]].
- Addressed issues with DataFrame resampling in [[Pandas]], ensuring proper date information retention.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a structured plan for investment [[strategy]] development and backtesting.
- Enhanced [[data visualization]] techniques and corrected errors in data handling using [[Pandas]].
- Improved financial [[data analysis]] by implementing exponential models and calculating opportunity metrics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the investment [[strategy]] by integrating additional data sources and refining the backtesting framework.
- Explore advanced risk management techniques and their integration into the current [[strategy]].
