### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and troubleshoot various trading algorithms using different frameworks such as Backtrader, PyAlgoTrade, and Zipline.

### Key Activities
- **Algorithm [[Development]]**: Explored structured approaches to building trading algorithms, including strategy definition, historical data handling, and compliance.
- **Framework Implementation**: Implemented custom trading strategies in Backtrader and PyAlgoTrade, focusing on residuals-based strategies and entry/exit criteria.
- **Error Resolution**: Addressed `AttributeError` in PyAlgoTrade by correcting data feed setup and resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` in Zipline by managing [[Python]] environment compatibility.
- **Environment Setup**: Created a [[Python]] 3.5 virtual environment for Zipline to ensure compatibility and avoid downgrading existing environments.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed trading strategies using Backtrader and PyAlgoTrade.
- Resolved critical errors in PyAlgoTrade and Zipline, ensuring smooth execution of trading strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of implemented strategies.
- Exploration of additional trading frameworks and strategies for enhanced performance.
