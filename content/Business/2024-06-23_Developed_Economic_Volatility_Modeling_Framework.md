### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for economic volatility modeling, focusing on simulation techniques and manuscript preparation.

### Key Activities
- Discussed a novel approach to economic volatility modeling, emphasizing the separation of micro to meso and meso to macro aggregation.
- Outlined a research paper titled 'Advanced Simulation Techniques for Modeling Economic Shocks,' detailing its structure and empirical applications.
- Planned thematic grouping of experiments related to microshocks, bootstrap analysis, and distribution analysis.
- Defined conditions for a robust theoretical framework, emphasizing clarity, empirical support, and mathematical rigor.
- Explored advanced simulation techniques using French trade data for empirical verification.
- Developed a strategic plan for manuscript development, including [[GitHub]] repository setup and writing phases.
- Set up a [[GitHub]] repository for the project, detailing repository creation, folder structuring, and initial README setup.

### Achievements
- Established a novel framework for economic volatility modeling.
- Prepared a detailed outline and plan for a research paper on economic shocks.
- Set up a [[GitHub]] repository for [[project management]] and collaboration.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue manuscript development and empirical validation of the proposed models.
