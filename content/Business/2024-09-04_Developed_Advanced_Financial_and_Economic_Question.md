### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop advanced financial and economic questions suitable for postgraduate-level challenges and to explore the impact of quantitative easing in macroeconomic contexts.

### Key Activities
- Received and reflected on feedback regarding the complexity of financial questions, noting that they were perceived as college-level despite revisions.
- Developed an advanced financial question incorporating stochastic processes, Geometric Brownian Motion, and inflation as a random variable.
- Identified suitable sub-specialization fields in Economics for studying stochastic interest rates.
- Calculated expected real annual interest rate using Geometric Brownian Motion.
- Compiled references for key financial concepts such as compounding interest and Geometric Brownian Motion.
- Created a systematic approach for task quality improvement.
- Explored modeling approaches for continuous dependent variables in statistics.
- Developed a complex question on quantitative easing and its effects on long-term interest rates and aggregate demand.
- Compiled references for understanding quantitative easing and its economic impact.
- Discussed the distinctions between classical and Keynesian economics.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed advanced financial questions incorporating complex economic theories.
- Gathered comprehensive references and resources to support the understanding of financial and economic concepts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of sub-specialization fields in Economics for deeper understanding of stochastic processes.
- Continued refinement of questions to ensure they meet the intended postgraduate difficulty level.
