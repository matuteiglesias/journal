### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine a QA testing workflow for NoSQL data, focusing on validating parsed data against original text to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Key Activities
- Prepared memos for the development team to finalize key points and provide feedback.
- Summarized progress on schema parsing and data processing, outlining challenges and next steps.
- Developed a [[Jupyter]] notebook structure for QA testing of NoSQL data.
- Outlined a QA testing workflow using [[Python]] for processing NoSQL data.
- Created a [[Python]] function to compare parsed data fields with original text.
- Developed a dynamic function for comprehensive QA comparison of parsed data.
- Updated [[AI]]-driven QA workflow using OpenAI to compare PDF text with NoSQL data.
- Refined [[AI]] prompt for legal document QA in Spanish.
- Implemented iterative file saving in [[Python]] for QA results.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive QA testing workflow for NoSQL data.
- Developed dynamic and [[AI]]-driven functions for data validation.
- Improved efficiency in data processing and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the refined [[AI]] prompt in production.
- Conduct further testing on the QA workflow with real datasets.
