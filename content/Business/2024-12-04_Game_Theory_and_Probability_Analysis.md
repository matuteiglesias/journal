## 📅 2024-12-04 — Session: Game Theory and Probability Analysis

**🕒 20:50–21:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Game Theory, Probability, Decision-Making, Python, Strategy  
**📂 Project**: Business  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze decision-making strategies and probability calculations in game theory and programming contexts.

### Key Activities
- Explored the practical relevance of naive strategies in decision-making under uncertainty.
- Identified and resolved an argument mismatch error in the `f_uniform()` function.
- Analyzed optimal strategies in a three-player game scenario to maximize expected payoff.
- Conducted a detailed analysis of winning probabilities and expected values in game scenarios.
- Developed [[Python]] functions to calculate and plot probabilities of winning and losing based on game conditions.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into the effectiveness of naive strategies as benchmarks and their robustness in low-data scenarios.
- Successfully fixed a programming error in the `f_uniform()` function.
- Enhanced understanding of game theory strategies and probability calculations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the [[Python]] functions for broader applicability in different game scenarios.
- Continue exploring Bayesian reasoning applications in decision-making strategies.
