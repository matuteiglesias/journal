### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore quantitative problem-solving approaches in capital management, focusing on data-driven decision-making, uncertainty modeling, and risk-reward balancing. Additionally, it involved practical implementations for financial analysis and visualization using [[Python]] libraries.

### Key Activities
- Introduced quantitative problem-solving approaches in capital management, emphasizing Bayesian reasoning, game theory, and pairs trading analysis.
- Conducted correlation analysis across various time windows to understand market relationships and implications for trading strategies.
- Analyzed the relative performance of AAPL and MSFT over a 90-day rolling return window, highlighting trading signals for pairs trading strategies.
- Provided instructions for installing and using the `yfinance` library for financial analysis.
- Developed and customized candlestick charts for AAPL and MSFT using the `mplfinance` library, focusing on aesthetics and annotations.
- Explored Bayesian inference for modeling uncertainty in decision-making contexts.

### Achievements
- Successfully introduced and outlined frameworks for quantitative problem-solving in capital management.
- Implemented and customized candlestick charts for financial data visualization, enhancing analysis capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of Bayesian inference applications in financial decision-making.
- Continuous refinement of visualization techniques for improved clarity and insight.
