**🕒 19:00–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Financial Modeling, Debt Management, Data Analysis, Visualization, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Business  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine financial models, particularly focusing on debt management and normalization of compounding rates.

### Key Activities
- Validated a model for calculating recharge based on observed data, including formula derivation and visualization techniques.
- Updated plots with enhanced grid designs and corrected plots using the `Cuenta` variable.
- Normalized compounding rates in financial models, providing a formula and implementation steps.
- Discussed the use of ballpark values for normalized rates in debt models for simplicity and scalability.
- Provided a practical approach for handling unknown balances in financial systems by incorporating 'deuda previa'.
- Outlined an implementation plan for a debt master calculator, including predictive modeling and anomaly detection.

### Achievements
- Achieved a structured approach to financial modeling and debt management.
- Enhanced visualization techniques for better data representation.
- Developed a comprehensive plan for future automation and model refinement.

### Pending Tasks
- Further feedback and adjustments on the updated plots.
- Implementation of the debt master calculator based on the outlined plan.
