## üìÖ 2025-05-11 ‚Äî Session: Developed frameworks for financial and AI systems analysis

**üïí 17:20‚Äì18:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Financial Analysis, Ai Systems, Metadata Management, Decision Making, Communication Strategies  
**üìÇ Project**: Business  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and develop frameworks for both financial decision-making and [[AI]] memory systems.

### Key Activities
- **Business [[Communication]] and Decision Analysis**: Discussed strategies for framing business proposals and created a 'loss leaderboard' for decision analysis. Explored frameworks for managing costs associated with poor quality, including COPQ and Lean Six Sigma methodologies.
- **[[AI]] Memory Systems**: Provided a technical overview of memory-augmented transformer architecture and analyzed memory and retrieval techniques in [[AI]] systems. Conducted a deep dive into user memory object encoding and vectorstore mastery.
- **[[Data Management]]**: Executed scripts for extracting and normalizing metadata from vectorstore into [[Pandas]] DataFrame, focusing on Chroma and FAISS with LangChain.

### Achievements
- Developed a structured approach to financial decision analysis and communication strategies.
- Enhanced understanding of [[AI]] memory systems and their technical frameworks.
- Successfully extracted and normalized metadata into a [[Pandas]] DataFrame.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced techniques in vector databases and embedded memory systems.
- Implementation of discussed frameworks in real-world scenarios to assess effectiveness.
