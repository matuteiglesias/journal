**üïí 00:00‚Äì00:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: financial processing, pipeline optimization, Jupyter notebooks, automation, integration  
**üìÇ Project**: Business  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve the financial processing pipeline by integrating various Jupyter notebooks into a cohesive and modular system, enhancing [[automation]] and error control.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed and proposed improvements for the onboarding process and financial management reports.
- Conducted critical analyses of multiple Jupyter notebooks (`income_monitor.ipynb`, `bills_ledger.ipynb`, `bills_ledger scenarios.ipynb`, `Cuadros.ipynb`) to identify integration issues and recommend modularization.
- Developed a [[strategy]] for continuous financial processing with a focus on monthly scheduling to ensure consistency.
- Created a structured directory for organizing scripts and artifacts related to financial processing.
- Provided Bash scripts to automate the creation of folder structures and Jupyter notebooks.
- Offered guidance on importing functions from [[Python]] scripts to enhance script modularity.

### Achievements
- Identified key areas for improvement in the financial pipeline and provided actionable recommendations.
- Established a directory structure and [[automation]] scripts to streamline financial processing tasks.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed integration of Jupyter notebooks into a master pipeline.
- Validate the effectiveness of the new folder structure and [[automation]] scripts in real-world scenarios.
