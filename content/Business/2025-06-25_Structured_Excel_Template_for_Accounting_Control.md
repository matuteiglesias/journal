### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a structured Excel template to facilitate accounting control, incorporating automation features and data integration capabilities.

### Key Activities
- **Excel Structure Proposal**: A detailed proposal was created for an Excel file to manage accounting control, including sheets for transactions, monthly totals, and reconciliation. Methods for importing data from the web were also proposed.
- **[[Pandas]] DataFrame Construction**: Demonstrated how to construct a DataFrame using pandas, reorder columns, convert date formats, and export it to Excel, enhancing data manipulation and export processes.
- **Movements Sheet Generation**: Created a 'Movements' sheet with concatenated debit/credit rows and a 'Period' column for easy filtering or pivoting. Options for adding monthly totals or additional accounting formulas were provided.
- **[[CSV]] Data [[Integration]]**: Provided [[CSV]] formatted financial data for integration into Excel, with options for appending to existing sheets or creating separate files. Data blocks for 2022 and 2023 were included, with a suggestion to compile data from 2022 to 2025 into a single Excel file.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive Excel template proposal for accounting control.
- Successfully demonstrated data manipulation with pandas and integration with Excel.
- Created a functional 'Movements' sheet for enhanced financial tracking.

### Pending Tasks
- Compile all financial data from 2022 to 2025 into a single Excel file for consolidated accounting.
- Implement additional accounting formulas as needed.
