## 📅 2025-07-05 — Session: Developed Python Pipelines for Wise Transactions

**🕒 21:30–21:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Transformation, Wise Transactions, Financial Analysis, Ledger Management  
**📂 Project**: Business  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim was to develop and refine [[Python]] pipelines for managing Wise transaction data, transforming it into a standardized ledger format, and ensuring accurate financial data aggregation.

### Key Activities
- **[[Data Management]]**: Identified missing transactions from Wise activity and prepared a raw [[CSV]]-style table for further processing.
- **Ledger Management**: Created structured Wise-style ledger entries and offered options for [[CSV]] download or integration.
- **[[Python]] Data Transformation**: Developed a [[Python]] pipeline using [[Pandas]] to transform Wise transaction datasets into a standardized ledger format, including input and output specifications.
- **Legacy Data Handling**: Outlined a canonical ledger pipeline for transforming legacy Wise datasets with parsing and processing functions.
- **Financial Data Aggregation**: Explored techniques for monthly financial aggregation, including net flow by currency and visual summaries.
- **Data Quality Considerations**: Addressed critical considerations for data aggregation accuracy, such as date consistency and avoiding double-counting.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and documented [[Python]] pipelines for transforming Wise transaction data.
- Established methods for monthly financial aggregation and ensured data quality in aggregation processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Integrate the developed [[Python]] pipelines into the existing data management system for automated processing.
- Conduct further testing to validate the accuracy of the financial data aggregation techniques.
