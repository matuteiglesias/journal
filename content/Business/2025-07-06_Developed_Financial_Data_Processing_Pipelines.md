### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine data processing pipelines for handling Wise transactions and financial data aggregation.

### Key Activities
- Identified missing transactions in Wise activity and prepared a [[CSV]]-style table for data management.
- Provided structured Wise-style ledger entries, with options for [[CSV]] download or larger ledger integration.
- Developed a [[Python]] pipeline to transform Wise transactions into a standardized ledger format using [[Pandas]].
- Outlined a canonical ledger pipeline for transforming legacy Wise datasets.
- Explored monthly financial aggregation techniques, including net monthly flow by currency and visual summaries.
- Discussed considerations for ensuring data aggregation accuracy, such as date format consistency and avoiding double-counting.

### Achievements
- Successfully created [[Python]] pipelines for transaction transformation and legacy dataset processing.
- Established methods for monthly financial data aggregation and visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- [[Integration]] of the developed pipelines into the existing financial management system.
- Further testing and validation of data aggregation techniques to ensure accuracy.
