### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and optimize [[Python]] functions for data extraction and processing tasks, specifically focusing on file handling, DataFrame operations, and geospatial data processing.

### Key Activities
- Discussed [[Python]] code related to file search and error handling.
- Implemented a `search` function to find strings within files and handle errors.
- Developed a function to search strings in text files and store results in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame.
- Extracted arguments from `pd.read_csv` and `gpd.read_file` using regular expressions.
- Created a boolean series in DataFrames to detect comments.
- Provided instructions for selecting cells in [[Pandas]] DataFrames in VS Code.
- Listed GeoJSON files using the `os` module and demonstrated file searching with the `glob` module.
- Calculated zonal statistics for GeoJSON files and provided code optimization suggestions.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and optimized multiple [[Python]] functions for data extraction and processing.
- Enhanced code efficiency and readability using list comprehensions and the `groupby` method.
- Improved file handling techniques with the `os` and `glob` modules.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize the zonal statistics calculation script for better performance.
- Explore additional code optimization techniques for large-scale data processing tasks.
