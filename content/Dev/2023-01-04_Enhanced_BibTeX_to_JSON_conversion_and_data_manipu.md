**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve the functionality of a [[Python]] script for converting BibTeX files to [[JSON]] and [[CSV]] formats, alongside performing data manipulation tasks using [[Pandas]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script to convert BibTeX entries into [[JSON]] and [[CSV]] formats, focusing on rearranging and sorting entries by year.
- Implemented error handling and additional features for the `bibtex_to_json` function, such as sorting by fields and specifying output file names.
- Utilized [[Pandas]] for data manipulation tasks, including converting DataFrame columns to numeric types, removing unwanted characters, and replacing 'null' values with `np.nan`.
- Explored text editing techniques in Visual Studio Code, such as indenting/un-indenting and converting cells to Markdown.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a robust [[Python]] script capable of converting, sorting, and saving BibTeX data in desired formats.
- Enhanced data processing capabilities with [[Pandas]], improving data cleaning and type conversion processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further enhancement of the `bibtex_to_json` function to support additional BibTeX entry types and parse more fields.
- Continued exploration of [[Python]] scripting for data management and conversion tasks.
