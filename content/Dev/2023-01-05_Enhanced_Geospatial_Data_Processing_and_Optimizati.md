**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to enhance geospatial data processing capabilities in [[Python]], focusing on error handling, directory management, and code optimization techniques.

### Key Activities
- Implemented error handling for GeoJSON file creation using `gpd.to_file`, ensuring necessary directories are created beforehand.
- Demonstrated directory creation and GeoDataFrame processing using `os.makedirs` and GeoJSON saving.
- Explored code optimization techniques for raster file processing, including list comprehensions and efficient data manipulation methods.
- Provided an overview and usage example of the `zonal_stats` function from the `rasterstats` module for raster data analysis.
- Developed [[Python]] code for reprojection of geographic data to the Mollweide projection and visualized population density using zonal statistics.
- Improved DataFrame operations efficiency in [[Python]], focusing on appending methods, regular expressions, and column selection.
- Processed DHS geographic variables in a DataFrame, restructuring data for analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully handled GeoJSON DriverError by ensuring directory existence.
- Optimized raster file processing and DataFrame operations, enhancing performance and clarity.
- Applied reprojection techniques and zonal statistics for effective geospatial analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced raster analysis techniques and integration with other geospatial libraries.
- Continued refinement of DataFrame manipulation techniques for large datasets.
