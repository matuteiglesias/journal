**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
To develop and refine scripts for data processing and conversion tasks using [[Python]].

### Key Activities:
- Created a directory and saved a DataFrame as a [[CSV]] file using the `os` module.
- Processed GeoJSON files to extract and merge household data, outputting consolidated [[CSV]] files.
- Reviewed and suggested code efficiency improvements for data manipulation with pandas.
- Developed a script to convert DAT files to [[CSV]] format using corresponding DCT files for parsing.
- Implemented a data processing script for HR data files, validating geographic codes and displaying data previews.
- Processed GeoJSON files for cluster data, merging information from [[CSV]] files based on geographic identifiers.
- Listed [[Jupyter]] Notebook files in the current directory using the glob module.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented multiple scripts for data processing and conversion.
- Enhanced code efficiency and data handling using pandas.
- Automated the conversion of DAT files to [[CSV]] format.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further optimization of data processing scripts for large datasets.
- [[Integration]] of additional validation checks in data conversion scripts.
