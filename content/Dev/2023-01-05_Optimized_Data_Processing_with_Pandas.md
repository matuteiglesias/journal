## 📅 2023-01-05 — Session: Optimized Data Processing with Pandas

**🕒 19:35–20:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, Data Processing, Python, Error Handling, CSV, Optimization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance data processing techniques using [[Pandas]], focusing on error handling, data analysis, and merging strategies.

### Key Activities:
- Explored methods for handling data import errors in [[Pandas]] using `error_bad_lines`, `usecols`, and `dtype` parameters.
- Discussed strategies for managing [[CSV]] errors and ensuring data integrity during import.
- Developed a workflow for data analysis, including calculating medians, counts, and quartiles, and saving results to [[CSV]].
- Implemented merging techniques for [[CSV]] files, consolidating data into a single DataFrame.
- Explored code optimization strategies to improve the efficiency of DataFrame processing.
- Enhanced code readability and maintainability in data processing scripts.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented error handling and data import strategies in [[Pandas]].
- Developed a comprehensive data processing workflow with analysis and merging capabilities.
- Improved code readability and performance in [[Python]] data processing tasks.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further optimization of data processing scripts for larger datasets.
- Exploration of additional [[Pandas]] features for advanced data manipulation.
