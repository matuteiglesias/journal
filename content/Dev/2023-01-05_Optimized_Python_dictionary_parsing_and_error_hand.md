**üïí 09:00‚Äì10:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Parsing, Optimization, Error Handling, Visual Studio Code  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripting techniques for parsing dictionary data, optimizing file reading, and handling [[JSON]] errors efficiently.

### Key Activities
- Explored tools in Visual Studio Code for file comparison, including built-in features and extensions.
- Developed a [[Python]] script for parsing dictionary data from DCF files, with a focus on optimization using context managers and list comprehensions.
- Demonstrated parsing of dictionary files using the `pycspro` library, converting data into [[Pandas]] DataFrames.
- Utilized `json.loads()` for parsing DCF files into [[Python]] dictionaries and extracting columns.
- Addressed JSONDecodeError by implementing utf-8-sig encoding for parsing raw dictionary variables.
- Discussed optimization techniques for reading [[CSV]] files and concatenating them into a single DataFrame using [[Pandas]].

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized dictionary parsing and file reading processes in [[Python]].
- Implemented effective error handling strategies for [[JSON]] parsing errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of additional [[Python]] libraries for data parsing efficiency improvements.
