## 📅 2023-01-12 — Session: Enhanced Python scripting with argparse and Jupyter

**🕒 12:25–12:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Argparse, Jupyter, Ipywidgets, Scripting  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripting capabilities by exploring the argparse library for command-line argument parsing and integrating interactive elements in [[Jupyter]] notebooks.

**Key Activities:**
- Reviewed a [[Python]] code snippet utilizing the argparse library, focusing on its structure and default values.
- Provided an example [[Python]] script for data processing using argparse, including default values and help messages.
- Offered guidance on running [[Jupyter]] notebooks from the command line, including using `nbconvert` for format conversion.
- Explained how to prompt user input in [[Jupyter]] notebooks using the `input()` function and introduced the ipywidgets library for creating interactive widgets.

**Achievements:**
- Clarified the use of argparse for command-line argument parsing in [[Python]] scripts.
- Demonstrated methods for executing and interacting with [[Jupyter]] notebooks from the command line.
- Introduced interactive user input techniques in [[Jupyter]] notebooks using ipywidgets.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Explore further customization options for ipywidgets to enhance user interaction in [[Jupyter]] notebooks.
