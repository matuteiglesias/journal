**üïí 19:00‚Äì19:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning, Pandas, Model Evaluation, Data Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to optimize the hyperparameters of a Random Forest model, specifically focusing on the `max_depth` parameter, to improve model evaluation metrics.

### Key Activities
- **Hyperparameter Iteration**: Iterated over different values of the `max_depth` hyperparameter in a Random Forest model, calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) for both training and test sets. Results were stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
- **DataFrame [[Optimization]]**: Enhanced DataFrame concatenation techniques in pandas by using `pd.concat()` for more efficient data manipulation.
- **Warning Resolution**: Addressed feature name warnings in `RandomForestClassifier` by ensuring correct feature names were used during model fitting.
- **Performance Metrics Aggregation**: Aggregated model performance metrics by grouping DataFrame data by model parameters and calculating statistics like mean absolute errors.
- **Quantile Calculation**: Calculated quantiles for model evaluation metrics to provide insights into the distribution of training and testing MAE.

### Achievements
- Successfully iterated over hyperparameters and stored results effectively.
- Improved DataFrame operations in pandas, leading to more efficient data processing.
- Resolved warnings related to feature names in `RandomForestClassifier`.
- Aggregated and analyzed model performance metrics to better understand model behavior.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of other hyperparameters for optimization.
- Detailed analysis of quantile results to inform future model adjustments.
