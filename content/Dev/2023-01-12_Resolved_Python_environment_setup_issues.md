**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Environment Management, Anaconda, Vs Code  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to address and resolve issues related to [[Python]] environment setup and management, specifically focusing on scikit-learn installation and configuration in different environments.

### Key Activities
- **Scikit-learn Installation Check**: Verified if scikit-learn was installed using [[Python]] import statements and pip commands.
- **ImportError [[Troubleshooting]]**: Identified common causes of `ImportError` for scikit-learn and explored solutions, including using virtual environments.
- **[[Python]] Environment Verification**: Used [[Jupyter]] Notebook and command line tools to check the current [[Python]] environment.
- **Conda Command Error Resolution**: Provided steps to fix 'conda: command not found' error by adjusting the PATH variable.
- **Environment Management with Anaconda**: Explained how to manage and switch between [[Python]] environments using Anaconda.
- **VS Code [[Configuration]]**: Configured the default [[Python]] environment in Visual Studio Code by modifying settings.json.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and resolved issues related to [[Python]] environment setup, ensuring scikit-learn can be used without errors.
- Configured development environments across different platforms, enhancing workflow efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced environment management techniques with Anaconda and Visual Studio Code might be beneficial for more complex projects.
