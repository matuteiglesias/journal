**üïí 14:05‚Äì14:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Jupyter, Vs Code, Python, Git, Nbconvert  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to explore the use of [[Jupyter]] magic commands within VS Code to enhance control over cell execution and script conversion, as well as manage [[Git]] repositories using [[Python]] scripts.

### Key Activities:
- Explored the use of [[Jupyter]] magic commands such as `%%script false`, `%%script true`, and `# %run` to control cell execution in VS Code.
- Investigated methods to prevent cell execution in interactive [[Jupyter]] notebooks while allowing script conversion with `nbconvert`.
- Developed [[Python]] scripts to manage directories and clone [[Git]] repositories using `os` and `gitpython` modules.
- Demonstrated checking and installing the `gitpython` module to automate repository cloning.

### Achievements:
- Gained insights into controlling [[Jupyter]] notebook cell execution within VS Code.
- Successfully created [[Python]] scripts for directory management and [[Git]] repository cloning.
- Enhanced understanding of automating [[Git]] operations with [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of advanced [[Jupyter]] magic commands for more complex execution control scenarios.
- [[Optimization]] of [[Python]] scripts for broader [[Git]] operations and directory management.
