**üïí 14:30‚Äì15:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Matplotlib, Data Visualization, Python, Pandas, Feature Importance, Machine Learning  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Matplotlib]] and [[Pandas]], focusing on customizing plots and improving readability through various methods.

### Key Activities:
- Explored methods to modify x-tick labels in [[Matplotlib]] using `xticks()`, `set_xticks()`, and `set_xticklabels()` to prevent overlap and enhance clarity.
- Implemented solutions for setting and customizing legend names in plots.
- Discussed methods for extracting middle values from tick labels using list comprehensions and regular expressions.
- Addressed setting multi-indexes in [[Pandas]] DataFrames and renaming index axes.
- Investigated feature importance methods in machine learning, including Permutation Importance and RandomForestClassifier.
- Demonstrated techniques for finding maximum values in DataFrame rows and calculating correlations.
- Created scatter plots and dual bar charts using [[Matplotlib]] and [[Pandas]], focusing on feature importance and correlations.

### Achievements:
- Successfully customized x-tick labels and legend names in [[Matplotlib]] plots.
- Enhanced understanding of feature importance in machine learning models.
- Improved skills in data manipulation with [[Pandas]], including multi-indexing and correlation analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of advanced data visualization techniques and their applications in machine learning.
- Continued practice on integrating [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]] for comprehensive data analysis.
