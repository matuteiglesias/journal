### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for automating Twitter interactions, specifically focusing on managing followers and file operations.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a [[Python]] function to write follower data to a file with a line limit to prevent overflow.
- Developed a function to save followers of users from a 'followers_list' file to a 'fu_candidates' file using the Tweepy [[API]].
- Created a function to write unique followers to a file, ensuring no duplicates by utilizing a set.
- Modified a function to follow users based on follower count, organizing user information into separate files based on follow status.
- Implemented a script to follow users with 1000 to 10000 followers, categorizing them into different files based on follow status.
- Developed a method to remove processed lines from a file using [[Python]] libraries `linecache` and `os`.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a suite of [[Python]] scripts to automate Twitter follower management and file operations.
- Enhanced functionality to ensure efficient data handling and user categorization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of scripts for edge cases and performance improvements.
