**üïí 16:50‚Äì18:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, File Handling, Ipython, Automation, Scripting  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripting skills, focusing on file handling, automation, and code organization in IPython notebooks.

### Key Activities
- **File Listing with `glob.glob()`**: Explored how to list files containing specific substrings in their names using the `glob` module.
- **Yearly [[Automation]] with For Loops**: Demonstrated executing commands over multiple years using `for` loops.
- **Optimizing Directory Management**: Discussed best practices for managing working directories in loops using `os.chdir()`.
- **Extracting Substrings from Filenames**: Illustrated methods for extracting years from filenames using regular expressions and string slicing.
- **Saving and Reporting DataFrames**: Provided a method to save pandas DataFrames to [[CSV]] files with size reporting.
- **Human-Readable File Sizes**: Introduced the `humanize` library for formatting file sizes.
- **Variable Management in IPython**: Explained defining and importing variables from external [[Python]] files into IPython notebooks.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into efficient file handling and directory management in [[Python]] scripts.
- Learned techniques for automating tasks over multiple years.
- Improved skills in organizing code and managing variables in IPython notebooks.

### Pending Tasks
- Explore additional libraries for file handling and automation.
- Implement learned techniques in a real-world project to assess their effectiveness.
