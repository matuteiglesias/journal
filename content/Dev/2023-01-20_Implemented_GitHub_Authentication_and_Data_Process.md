## üìÖ 2023-01-20 ‚Äî Session: Implemented GitHub Authentication and Data Processing Functions

**üïí 21:30‚Äì23:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Github, SSH, Python, Data Processing, Authentication  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to transition from password-based authentication to SSH and Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for GitHub, and to implement [[Python]] functions for data processing.

### Key Activities
- Explored GitHub's transition from password authentication to SSH and PATs, detailing setup steps for each method.
- Provided guidelines for SSH key pair naming and storage, emphasizing security and backup.
- Reflected on the use of SSH key passphrases for enhanced security.
- Outlined steps to push code to a remote GitHub repository using a PAT.
- Defined a [[Python]] function for iterative prediction with varying parameters, incorporating file management best practices.
- Demonstrated the use of the `predict_save` function in data processing, optimizing parameter usage.
- Explained the iteration over function arguments using dictionaries in [[Python]] for the `predict_save` function.
- Reviewed the `ajustar_empleo()` function for adjusting employment levels in a pandas DataFrame, suggesting improvements in verbosity and input validation.

### Achievements
- Successfully transitioned to more secure GitHub authentication methods.
- Developed and optimized [[Python]] functions for data processing and iteration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further improve input validation and verbosity in the `ajustar_empleo()` function.
