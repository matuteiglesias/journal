**üïí 15:50‚Äì17:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Efficiency, Dask, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve the clarity and efficiency of [[Python]] code used for data processing, particularly with pandas and Dask, and to encapsulate data operations into reusable functions.

### Key Activities
- Explored strategies for improving code clarity and efficiency in [[Python]], focusing on descriptive variable names, comments, and pandas methods.
- Developed code to process unemployment rate data, creating new columns and filtering data.
- Demonstrated file retrieval and date extraction from file names using `glob`, `os.scandir()`, and regular expressions.
- Reviewed and enhanced functions like `ajustar_empleo()` and `predict_save()` for data manipulation and prediction.
- Discussed key questions for data analytics in a Java programming context.
- Provided insights on optimizing [[Pandas]] DataFrame operations and encapsulating data processing functions.
- Improved DataFrame merge functions for better readability and performance.
- Applied Dask for sampling, merging, and optimizing large dataset operations, demonstrating delayed computation and multi-core processing.

### Achievements
- Improved code clarity and efficiency in data processing tasks.
- Enhanced understanding and application of Dask for large datasets.
- Developed reusable functions for data processing and analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize functions for specific use cases in data processing.
- Explore additional Dask capabilities for performance enhancement.
