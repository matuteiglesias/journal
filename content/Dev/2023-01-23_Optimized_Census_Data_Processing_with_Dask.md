## 📅 2023-01-23 — Session: Optimized Census Data Processing with Dask

**🕒 01:45–03:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Dask, Data Processing, Optimization, Python, Census Data  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the processing of census data using Dask and [[Python]], focusing on loading, filtering, and merging datasets efficiently.

### Key Activities
- **Data Loading**: Utilized Dask and pandas to load and filter census data from [[CSV]] files, specifically targeting housing, households, and individual datasets.
- **[[Data Processing]]**: Implemented workflows using Dask for handling large datasets, including merging, sampling, and computing ratios based on population projections.
- **Code Correction**: Corrected [[Python]] code for Dask DataFrames to ensure the use of the `compute()` function for accurate data retrieval.
- **[[Optimization]]**: Discussed and implemented optimizations such as pre-computation before merging and using `with ProgressBar():` for tracking operations.

### Achievements
- Successfully loaded and filtered large datasets using Dask and pandas.
- Improved data processing efficiency by optimizing code for merging operations and reducing unnecessary computations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of data processing workflows to enhance performance.
- Exploration of additional Dask features for better handling of large datasets.
