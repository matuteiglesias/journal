## üìÖ 2023-02-07 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced DataFrame Operations and Error Handling in Python

**üïí 15:55‚Äì16:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Dataframes, Error Handling, Dynamic Variables, Data Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] programming skills specifically related to DataFrame operations, including comparison, tally calculation, error handling, and dynamic variable assignment.

### Key Activities:
- **Corrected [[Python]] Code for DataFrame Comparison:** Developed a function to compare multiple DataFrames based on project ID columns, resulting in a DataFrame that indicates intersection counts.
- **Country Tally Calculation Function:** Created a [[Python]] function to calculate country tallies from a DataFrame and merge them into a single comprehensive DataFrame.
- **Handling GroupBy Errors:** Addressed mismatch errors in DataFrames when using the `groupby` function by concatenating column names for proper indexing.
- **Programmatic Function Outcome Assignment:** Demonstrated storing function outcomes in a list for easy access and manipulation using indexing.
- **Dynamic Variable Assignment with Dictionaries:** Explored using dictionaries instead of `exec` for dynamic variable assignment, enhancing code security and clarity.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented and tested various DataFrame operations and error handling techniques.
- Improved understanding of dynamic variable assignment in [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of more advanced DataFrame manipulation techniques may be beneficial in future sessions.
