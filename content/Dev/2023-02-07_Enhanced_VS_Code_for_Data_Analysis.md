## 📅 2023-02-07 — Session: Enhanced VS Code for Data Analysis

**🕒 14:00–15:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Vs Code, Python, Pandas, Configuration, Data Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to optimize the Visual Studio Code environment for efficient data analysis and manipulation using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].

### Key Activities
- **[[Configuration]] Adjustments**: Enhanced the output display settings in VS Code's Integrated Terminal and adjusted [[Pandas]] DataFrame display settings.
- **Scrollback and Auto-Advance Settings**: Modified the `terminal.integrated.scrollback` and disabled auto-advance in the [[Python]] extension to improve workflow.
- **[[Python]] Environment Setup**: Changed the default [[Python]] interpreter and created custom keybindings for productivity.
- **DataFrame Operations**: Developed functions for merging, processing, and analyzing [[Pandas]] DataFrames, including handling compatibility issues with the `xlrd` library.

### Achievements
- Successfully configured Visual Studio Code for better handling of large outputs and improved navigation.
- Created reusable [[Python]] functions for data manipulation, enhancing code efficiency.
- Resolved compatibility issues with the `xlrd` library, ensuring smooth data import operations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of new configurations and functions to ensure stability and performance in different scenarios.
