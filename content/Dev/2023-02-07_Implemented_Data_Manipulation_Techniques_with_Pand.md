## 📅 2023-02-07 — Session: Implemented Data Manipulation Techniques with Pandas

**🕒 19:40–20:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Data Manipulation, Geopandas, Dataframe  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and implement various data manipulation techniques using the [[Pandas]] library in [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Provided code examples for manipulating and structuring data related to various countries using [[Pandas]].
- Demonstrated how to handle and format data strings, including an alternative solution using string splitting techniques.
- Illustrated the use of the `rpartition` method to split strings into a DataFrame with distinct columns.
- Showcased the conversion of `apply` method results into a new DataFrame with specified column names.
- Transformed a DataFrame by exploding values in a specified column and pivoting based on the exploded values.
- Conducted a spatial join of geospatial dataframes using the GeoPandas library to find points within specified areas.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented various data manipulation techniques using [[Pandas]] and GeoPandas.
- Clarified the process of transforming and merging DataFrames with new structures.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced data manipulation techniques and optimization strategies for large datasets.
