**üïí 14:35‚Äì16:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Web Scraping, Language Translation, Fuzzywuzzy, Google Translate  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop and refine [[Python]]-based tools for language translation and string similarity calculations, leveraging libraries like FuzzyWuzzy, BeautifulSoup, and Google Translate [[API]].

### Key Activities:
- **String Similarity Calculation**: Implemented a method using the FuzzyWuzzy library to calculate string similarity between two columns in a DataFrame.
- **[[Web Scraping]] for Language Data**: Created a [[Python]] script utilizing BeautifulSoup to scrape a webpage for the 1000 most common Portuguese words and their English translations, storing the data in a pandas DataFrame.
- **Google Sheets Translation**: Explored the use of Google Translate [[API]] for translating text in Google Sheets, considering both [[Python]] and Google Apps Script for implementation.
- **Language Translation Game**: Developed a [[Python]]-based interactive game for language translation, allowing users to translate Portuguese words into Spanish, with feedback and multiple attempts for each word.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented string similarity calculations and web scraping scripts.
- Explored potential integrations of Google Translate [[API]] with Google Sheets.
- Developed a functional interactive language translation game in [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks:
- Further integration of Google Translate [[API]] with Google Sheets needs to be tested and documented.
- [[Optimization]] of the language translation game for better user experience.
