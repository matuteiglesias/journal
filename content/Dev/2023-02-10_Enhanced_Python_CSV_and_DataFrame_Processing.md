## 📅 2023-02-10 — Session: Enhanced Python CSV and DataFrame Processing

**🕒 00:05–01:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, CSV, Dataframe, Error Handling, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripts for processing [[CSV]] files and manipulating DataFrames, focusing on file handling, data transformation, and error management.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed [[Python]] code for [[CSV]] transformation, including renaming output files based on specific criteria.
- Reworked a function to modify file paths and ensure target directories exist, demonstrating usage in a loop with [[CSV]] files.
- Updated functions for transforming file paths and names, extracting tags, and formatting output correctly.
- Implemented [[CSV]] file processing using pandas, grouping data by specific columns and saving results.
- Applied string manipulation in DataFrame columns using `str.zfill()` to add leading zeros.
- Corrected string modification code and addressed an `AttributeError` by ensuring inputs are strings.
- Created a mapping dictionary to correct spelling discrepancies in datasets.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully refactored and enhanced [[Python]] code for [[CSV]] and DataFrame operations.
- Improved error handling and data processing techniques.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the updated functions in different scenarios to ensure robustness.
- [[Integration]] of these functions into larger data processing pipelines.
