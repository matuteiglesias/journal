## üìÖ 2023-02-13 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced CSV processing and DataFrame comparison

**üïí 20:40‚Äì22:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Dataframe, CSV, Performance, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripts for [[CSV]] processing and DataFrame comparison, focusing on performance measurement and error handling.

**Key Activities:**
- Utilized `%timeit` and `%time` magic commands in IPython Notebook to measure execution time for code snippets.
- Modified [[CSV]] processing code to handle `OSError` by checking and creating output directories as needed.
- Implemented file copying techniques using [[Python]]'s `os`, `shutil`, and `glob` libraries.
- Explored the `replace` method in pandas DataFrame for value mapping without introducing NaN values.
- Developed methods to compare DataFrames and count column differences, highlighting changes and common differences.
- Created code snippets to identify and print differences between DataFrames, excluding NaN values.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully integrated performance profiling into [[CSV]] processing scripts.
- Improved error handling in file operations.
- Enhanced DataFrame comparison techniques to provide more insightful data analysis.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further optimize the [[CSV]] processing script for larger datasets.
- Explore additional methods for DataFrame comparison to improve accuracy and performance.
