## üìÖ 2023-02-13 ‚Äî Session: Optimized Data Processing and Performance Measurement in Python

**üïí 16:00‚Äì18:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Performance Measurement, Optimization, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance data processing efficiency and performance measurement in [[Python]], focusing on serialization, data manipulation, and optimization techniques.

### Key Activities
- **Data Serialization**: Implemented methods to save and load [[Python]] dictionaries using `pickle` and `json` modules, highlighting differences in data type handling.
- **[[Data Processing]]**: Merged [[Python]] scripts for [[CSV]] processing using [[Pandas]], optimizing code by removing unnecessary loops and enhancing data reading efficiency.
- **DataFrame Manipulation**: Simplified aggregation operations in [[Pandas]] DataFrames and addressed `NaN` indexing issues using `str.contains`.
- **Performance Measurement**: Developed scripts to measure [[CSV]] read times and memory usage, utilizing [[Python]]'s `time` library and `memory_profiler`, and explored execution time measurement using VS Code debugger and a custom time measurement decorator.
- **Linux [[Troubleshooting]]**: Reflected on SquashFS errors and kernel panic issues in Linux, proposing potential hardware and software solutions.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized data processing scripts, improving runtime efficiency and resource usage.
- Developed robust performance measurement tools, aiding in code optimization and debugging.
- Resolved DataFrame indexing errors, enhancing data manipulation reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of Linux troubleshooting techniques, particularly in resolving SquashFS errors and kernel panic situations.
- Continued refinement of performance measurement scripts to include more detailed analytics and reporting.
