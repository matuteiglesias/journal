**üïí 12:00‚Äì13:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Jupyter, Automation, Error Handling, Python, Scripting  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to automate the execution of [[Jupyter]] notebooks and improve error handling during their execution.

### Key Activities
- Explored methods for programmatically running [[Jupyter]] notebooks using `nbconvert` and `nbformat`.
- Installed `ipykernel` in an Anaconda environment to support [[Jupyter]] functionality.
- Developed a script for executing notebooks in a directory with error handling to stop on errors and continue with the next notebook.
- Enhanced the `run_notebooks_in_directory` function to handle errors by resuming execution from the last successful notebook.
- Implemented recursive execution of notebooks in sub-directories.
- Modified the `run_notebook` function to extract and print detailed error information using the traceback module.
- Automated the addition of import statements to the first cell of [[Jupyter]] notebooks to ensure necessary libraries are included.

### Achievements
- Successfully automated the execution of [[Jupyter]] notebooks with robust error handling.
- Improved the error reporting mechanism to provide detailed traceback information.
- Automated import statement insertion, enhancing notebook setup efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the automated scripts in diverse environments to ensure reliability.
- [[Optimization]] of the error handling logic to cover more edge cases.
