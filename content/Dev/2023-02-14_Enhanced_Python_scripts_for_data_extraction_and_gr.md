**üïí 04:25‚Äì04:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Extraction, Graph Visualization, Pandas, Networkx  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripts for data extraction, manipulation, and visualization, focusing on improving file handling, DataFrame operations, and graph visualization using NetworkX.

### Key Activities:
- Corrected [[Python]] code for extracting filenames and IO information from [[Jupyter]] Notebook files, ensuring proper appending to `current_inputs`.
- Implemented logic to explode lists within [[Pandas]] DataFrame columns, transforming them into multiple rows for better data manipulation.
- Modified data processing workflow to explode DataFrame before concatenation, optimizing data handling.
- Enhanced script for detecting file operations, improving pattern recognition for [[CSV]] and geospatial files.
- Developed a directed graph using NetworkX to represent relationships between data files and notebooks, including nodes and edges.
- Visualized graphs using NetworkX and [[Matplotlib]], employing flow diagram layouts and addressing module limitations for graph visualization.

### Achievements:
- Successfully corrected and optimized [[Python]] scripts for file handling and data extraction.
- Improved data manipulation techniques using [[Pandas]], enhancing DataFrame processing.
- Created and visualized directed graphs with NetworkX, effectively representing data relationships.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of advanced graph visualization techniques and optimization strategies for large datasets.
- Review and refine file operation detection logic for broader file type support.
