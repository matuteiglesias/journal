## üìÖ 2023-02-14 ‚Äî Session: Geospatial Data Troubleshooting and Enhancement

**üïí 20:45‚Äì22:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Geospatial, Geopandas, Error Handling, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and troubleshoot issues related to geospatial data processing, specifically focusing on errors in coordinate values, updating software dependencies, and exploring alternative methods for geospatial analysis.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Coordinate Errors**: Explored potential causes and solutions for errors in coordinate values within geometries, focusing on data integrity and geometry validity.
- **Software Update**: Provided instructions for upgrading the [[Pandas]] library to its latest version, highlighting potential breaking changes.
- **Geospatial Analysis Techniques**: Discussed alternative methods to the `sjoin` function in GeoPandas, including using the `contains` method and PySAL for spatial joins.
- **GeoDataFrame Overlay**: Explained the use of the GeoDataFrame overlay function in GeoPandas for spatial overlay operations.
- **Code Analysis**: Analyzed a code snippet for reading [[CSV]] files with pandas, offering suggestions for improvements.
- **Feature Counting in GeoJSON**: Demonstrated methods to count features in GeoJSON files using GeoPandas and the `ogrinfo` command-line tool.
- **Error Resolution**: Provided solutions for handling the 'GeoJSON object too complex' error in `ogrinfo`.

### Achievements
- Identified and documented solutions for common geospatial data errors.
- Updated software dependencies to ensure compatibility and performance.
- Enhanced understanding of geospatial analysis techniques and tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of alternative geospatial methods in different datasets to validate their effectiveness.
- Continuous monitoring for updates in geospatial libraries to preemptively address potential issues.
