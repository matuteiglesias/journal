## üìÖ 2023-02-14 ‚Äî Session: Optimized Python and VS Code workflows

**üïí 15:25‚Äì19:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Vs Code, Pandas, Ubuntu, Whatsapp  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance productivity and efficiency in software development and data manipulation using [[Python]] and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

**Key Activities:**
- Explored WhatsApp's 'Call Phones' feature to make calls to non-WhatsApp users and discussed workarounds for regions without this feature.
- Disabled GitHub Copilot suggestions and enabled path suggestions in VS Code to improve the coding environment.
- Executed all tests and configured [[Jupyter]] Notebooks in VS Code, including setting the default [[Python]] interpreter.
- Troubleshot keyboard shortcuts in VS Code and enhanced file search functions in [[Python]].
- Monitored memory usage on Ubuntu and analyzed processes to manage resources effectively.
- Addressed [[Pandas]] deprecation warnings by transitioning from `append()` to `concat()` and handled potential errors in DataFrame operations.
- Demonstrated directory management in [[Python]] using the os module.

**Achievements:**
- Improved understanding and configuration of VS Code for better development workflows.
- Enhanced [[Python]] coding practices, particularly in data manipulation with [[Pandas]].
- Established methods for effective system resource monitoring on Ubuntu.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of WhatsApp's communication features for business use.
- Continuous monitoring of memory usage trends on Ubuntu to preemptively address potential issues.
