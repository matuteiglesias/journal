### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine a [[Python]] script capable of extracting input and output file paths from [[Jupyter]] notebook files (.ipynb).

### Key Activities
- Developed a script to analyze read and write commands in [[Jupyter]] notebooks for extracting [[CSV]] and GeoDataFrame file paths.
- Corrected a variable name typo in the code to ensure proper functionality.
- Created a dataframe using [[Python]] and pandas to systematically extract file I/O information.
- Enhanced the code to check if function calls are commented out.
- Refactored the script to include a function dedicated to handling input and output file information extraction.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a [[Python]] script that extracts and processes input and output file paths from [[Jupyter]] notebooks.
- Improved code quality through refactoring and error correction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the script in diverse notebook environments to ensure robustness and accuracy.
