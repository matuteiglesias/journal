## 📅 2023-02-15 — Session: Developed Python Scripts for Propensity Score Matching

**🕒 14:10–16:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Propensity Score Matching, Infrastructure Investment, Data Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for implementing Propensity Score Matching (PSM) in infrastructure investment studies.

### Key Activities:
- Reviewed literature on infrastructure investment and economic growth, focusing on methodologies like propensity score matching (PSM).
- Expanded the methods section for evaluating infrastructure investment impacts, detailing sample selection, outcome variables, covariates, and regression analysis.
- Developed [[Python]] code snippets for estimating treatment effects using PSM, including logistic regression for propensity score estimation and nearest neighbor matching.
- Addressed an undefined variable error in PSM code and provided a corrected version.
- Discussed the importance of incorporating confounding variables in PSM models to enhance accuracy.

### Achievements:
- Successfully created [[Python]] scripts for PSM, including data handling, model fitting, and treatment effect estimation.
- Clarified the role of confounders in PSM models and their impact on treatment effect accuracy.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further validation and testing of the developed scripts using real-world datasets.
- Exploration of additional [[Python]] packages like `causalml` and `sklearn` for PSM implementation.
