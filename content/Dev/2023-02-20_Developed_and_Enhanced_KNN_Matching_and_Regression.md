## 📅 2023-02-20 — Session: Developed and Enhanced KNN Matching and Regression Functions

**🕒 07:10–08:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: KNN, Regression, Python, Data Analysis, Simulation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to address errors in matrix multiplication during regression analysis and to develop and enhance functions for KNN matching and regression analysis for treatment effect estimation.

**Key Activities:**
- Reflected on matrix multiplication errors in regression analysis, identifying shape incompatibility issues and suggesting troubleshooting methods.
- Developed a [[Python]] function for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) matching, utilizing linear assignment to create matched pairs from treated and control units.
- Created a regression analysis function to estimate the average treatment effect using matched pairs, leveraging the statsmodels library.
- Generated simulated datasets with specific characteristics, including covariates and treatment effects, using logistic and linear regression models.
- Enhanced the `knn_matching` function to process a single DataFrame, improving efficiency and usability.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully identified and addressed matrix multiplication errors in regression analysis.
- Developed and enhanced KNN matching functions for better data processing and treatment effect estimation.
- Generated simulated data for robust testing of analysis functions.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced KNN matching function with diverse datasets.
- Exploration of additional error handling strategies for regression analysis.
