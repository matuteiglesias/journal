**üïí 08:35‚Äì10:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Regression Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Python]] libraries, specifically focusing on Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities
- Implemented [[Python]] code for concatenating data into a single DataFrame using pandas, followed by visualization with Seaborn.
- Customized box plot aesthetics using Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]], including style, color palette, and dimensions.
- Utilized the `hue` parameter in Seaborn's catplot for grouping data by multiple columns.
- Addressed floating-point precision issues in [[Python]], particularly in rounding numbers for plotting.
- Customized x-axis tick labels in Seaborn catplots and rounded x-tick labels in box plots.
- Developed functions for running experiments with matching and regression analysis, including parameter sweeps and saving results to [[CSV]].
- Modified regression analysis functions to use `pd.concat` instead of the deprecated `append` method.
- Created scatter plots with error bars and added diagonal lines to [[Matplotlib]] plots.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and tested various data visualization techniques, improving the clarity and aesthetics of plots.
- Enhanced the functionality of existing [[Python]] functions for data analysis and visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced data visualization techniques and integration with larger datasets.
