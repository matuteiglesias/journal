### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to convert [[Jupyter]] Notebooks to PDF format while maintaining the directory structure and to troubleshoot any errors encountered during the process.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the impact of parameter p1 on treatment assignment and ATE estimation, focusing on its role as a potential confounding variable.
- Provided a command to convert all .ipynb files in subdirectories to PDFs using `nbconvert`, and saved them in a 'mirror' directory.
- Addressed troubleshooting steps for `nbconvert` command errors, including command verification and directory checks.
- Utilized the `find` command to target only files for conversion, resolving errors related to directory conversion.
- Demonstrated the use of the `tree` command with the `-L` option to display and print subdirectories, saving the output to `tree.txt`.
- Communicated with the team about code uploads to Dropbox and offered to improve code communication.

### Achievements
- Successfully converted [[Jupyter]] Notebooks to PDFs while preserving the directory structure.
- Resolved errors related to the `nbconvert` command by refining the command usage.
- Enhanced team communication regarding code uploads and directory structures.

### Pending Tasks
- Schedule a call with Eric to discuss further improvements in code communication and directory management.
