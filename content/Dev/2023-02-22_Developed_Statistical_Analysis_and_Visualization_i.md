## 📅 2023-02-22 — Session: Developed Statistical Analysis and Visualization in Python

**🕒 04:55–05:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Analysis, Visualization, Statistics, ATE  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance statistical analysis and data visualization techniques using [[Python]], focusing on treatment differences and parameter sweeping for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) calculations.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a loop to calculate and print the mean and standard deviation of treatment group differences (`diff1` and `diff2`).
- Performed linear regression on grouped data using SciPy, including error bars and printing the linear equation.
- Used [[Matplotlib]] to plot lines based on linear equations (`y = m*x + b`).
- Conducted parameter sweeping to calculate ATE, capturing mean and standard deviation results.

### Achievements
- Successfully executed statistical analysis of treatment differences.
- Developed and visualized linear regression models with error bars.
- Implemented parameter sweeping for ATE calculations, enhancing data analysis capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of parameter impacts on ATE results could be beneficial for deeper insights.
