### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance [[Python]] functions for plotting Average Treatment Effect (ATE) lines, making them more flexible and dynamic for data visualization tasks.

### Key Activities
- Defined a function to calculate and plot ATE_f using seaborn, focusing on box plot visualization.
- Developed a function to generate scatterplots with ATE lines, including error bars for standard deviations.
- Created the `add_ATE_line` function to integrate ATE lines into plots, with examples of usage.
- Modified the `add_ATE_line` function to accept arrays for plotting multiple ATE lines based on unique sweep parameter values.
- Enhanced the `add_ATE_line` function to support dynamic parameter sweeping, allowing flexible plotting based on various parameters.
- Updated the `add_ATE_line` function to include default parameters for plotting ATE values against a specified sweep parameter.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and modified functions for plotting ATE lines, improving flexibility and usability for data visualization tasks in [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the modified functions in diverse datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
