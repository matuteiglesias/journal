## 📅 2023-02-22 — Session: Implemented ATE in DataFrame and Explored Linear Regression

**🕒 01:45–03:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Linear Regression, ATE, Dataframe, Python, Statistics  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to explore the linkages in linear regression models and implement the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in a [[Python]] DataFrame for experimental data analysis.

**Key Activities:**
- Provided a formal demonstration of the mathematical linkages in linear regression and the calculation of ATE, focusing on treatment propensity and outcome variables.
- Detailed the derivation of ATE as a function of parameter a_1, simplifying expressions to reach a linear form.
- Implemented code to add ATE values to an experiment's DataFrame using [[Pandas]], modifying the DataFrame structure to incorporate parameters like `a1` and `p1`.
- Created a new DataFrame to hold ATE calculations and demonstrated concatenation with existing data using pandas.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully integrated ATE calculations into the experimental data workflow, enhancing the analysis capabilities within the [[Python]] environment.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further validation of the ATE implementation and exploration of its implications on experimental results.
- [[Documentation]] of the implemented changes for future reference and reproducibility.
