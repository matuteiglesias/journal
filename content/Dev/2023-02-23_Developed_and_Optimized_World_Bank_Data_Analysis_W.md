**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Analysis, Pandas, Geopandas, World Bank, Code Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive data analysis workflow for World Bank investment datasets, focusing on data cleaning, merging, and visualization using [[Pandas]] and GeoPandas.

**Key Activities:**
- Created a code workflow for processing World Bank investment datasets, incorporating data cleaning, merging, and visualization techniques.
- Outlined a structured notebook for data analysis, detailing sections on setup, data preprocessing, analysis, conclusion, and references.
- Explored World Bank resources for accessing country names and ISO codes, and provided instructions for downloading and using these resources in [[Python]] with [[Pandas]].
- Developed a [[Python]] function to integrate country names into a GeoDataFrame based on country codes, enhancing code modularity and readability.
- Provided code improvement suggestions, including organizing imports, removing unused code, and cleaning up comments.
- Offered code review suggestions for improved efficiency, such as function consolidation and enhanced documentation.
- Updated [[Python]] code for GeoDataFrame intersection to address ShapelyDeprecationWarning errors and improve efficiency.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully developed a modular and efficient data analysis workflow for World Bank datasets.
- Enhanced code quality and efficiency through refactoring and optimization.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further test and validate the developed functions and workflows with additional datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
