## üìÖ 2023-02-23 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Generation and Visualization Functions

**üïí 06:45‚Äì08:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Generation, Visualization, Refactoring, Function Enhancement  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The objective of this session was to enhance and refactor [[Python]] functions related to data generation and visualization, focusing on flexibility and maintainability.

**Key Activities:**
- Updated the `generate_data()` function to include a boolean argument `use_formula_2` for selecting treatment distribution formulas.
- Implemented the use of `np.random.choice` to generate a treatment variable with equal probability of 0s and 1s.
- Modified the `generate_data` function to include a `use_prob_dist` argument, allowing selection between binomial and choice distributions.
- Defined a function to generate synthetic data for regression problems with options for treatment group balancing.
- Refactored code to reduce duplication by creating functions for similar operations.
- Updated a [[Python]] plotting function to pass figure and axis objects as arguments for streamlined plotting.
- Enhanced the `scatterplot_results` function with a `plot_kwargs` parameter for additional plotting arguments.
- Demonstrated the use of `plot_kwargs` in the `scatterplot_sts()` function to customize plot appearance.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully updated and refactored functions to improve code flexibility and maintainability.
- Enhanced data visualization functions to allow for more customizable plots.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the updated functions to ensure robustness in various scenarios.
- [[Documentation]] updates to reflect changes in function parameters and usage examples.
