### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and execute various geospatial data processing tasks involving GeoJSON files.

### Key Activities
- **Handling GeoJSON File Overwrite Error:** Implemented solutions for the GeoJSON driver error using `ogrinfo` and `ogr2ogr` commands to extract features.
- **GeoJSON Conversion:** Utilized `ogr2ogr` for converting datasets to GeoJSON format and verified using [[Python]]'s Geopandas.
- **SQL Query Issues:** Resolved SQL query issues related to special characters in column names.
- **Splitting GeoJSON Files:** Employed `ogr2ogr`, `gdal_retile.py`, and `geojsplit` for splitting GeoJSON files into smaller parts, with detailed command options.
- **Clipping GeoJSON Files:** Used `ogr2ogr` for clipping GeoJSON data, addressing limitations of `gdal_retile.py`.
- **Feature Counting:** Applied `ogrinfo` from GDAL to count features in GeoJSON files.
- **Reading with GeoPandas:** Demonstrated reading GeoJSON files using GeoPandas in [[Python]].

### Achievements
Successfully executed a series of geospatial data processing tasks, enhancing the handling and manipulation of GeoJSON files through command line and [[Python]] tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced geospatial data processing techniques and optimization of current workflows.
