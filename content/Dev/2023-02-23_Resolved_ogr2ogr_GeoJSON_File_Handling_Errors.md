**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to resolve errors encountered when using the `ogr2ogr` tool to process GeoJSON files, specifically focusing on driver errors and size limitations.

### Key Activities
- **Resolving Driver Error**: Modified the `ogr2ogr` command to include the `-f GeoJSONSeq` option to handle GeoJSON files properly.
- **Handling Large Files**: Addressed issues with processing large GeoJSON files by modifying environment variables to increase the maximum size limit for features.
- **[[Python]] [[Integration]]**: Provided a [[Python]] code snippet for setting environment variables to prevent the 'GeoJSON object too complex' error.
- **Feature Extraction**: Used `ogr2ogr` to extract the last 100 features from a GeoJSON file by skipping a set number of features.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the driver error and size limitation issues, enabling smoother processing of GeoJSON files with `ogr2ogr`.
- Integrated solutions into [[Python]] scripts for automated handling of large GeoJSON files.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the implemented solutions in different environments to ensure robustness and compatibility with various GeoJSON datasets.
