**🕒 00:15–00:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Analysis, Code Optimization, Regression  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to optimize data loading and regression code in [[Python]] for improved efficiency and performance.

### Key Activities
- Optimized [[Python]] code for loading project information, violence levels, and covariates.
- Implemented cleaner data handling and efficient merging of datasets.
- Developed an aggregation function for pandas DataFrames to allow flexible data analysis.
- Modified a custom `groupby_aggregate` function to accept customizable aggregation functions.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized data loading and regression processes.
- Enhanced data manipulation capabilities with new aggregation functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the optimized code to ensure robustness and accuracy.
