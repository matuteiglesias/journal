**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Percentiles  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The aim of this session was to develop [[Python]] functions for visualizing data related to treatment and control groups, with a focus on computing percentiles and plotting balance information using Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities:
- Computed the 25%, 50%, and 75% percentiles for covariates in treatment and control groups using a [[Pandas]] dataframe.
- Resolved column mismatch errors in DataFrame percentile calculations by transposing results.
- Developed a function using Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]] to plot balance information, incorporating error bars for statistical accuracy.
- Modified Seaborn's `catplot()` to adjust bar width and ensure error bars align with data points.
- Enhanced plot functions to visualize treatment group balance with error bars, using Seaborn's pointplot.
- Fixed Seaborn plot styles and x-labels to improve visual clarity.
- Updated the `plot_balance` function to include legends and customize plot aesthetics for treated and control groups.

### Achievements:
- Successfully created and refined multiple [[Python]] functions for data visualization that handle error bars and legends effectively.
- Improved the accuracy and aesthetics of balance plots for treatment analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of the developed functions with diverse datasets to ensure robustness and adaptability.
