## üìÖ 2023-03-06 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization and Food Data Processing

**üïí 01:10‚Äì03:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Pandas, Nutrition, Code Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques and process nutritional data efficiently using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]], [[Matplotlib]], and Seaborn.

### Key Activities
- Utilized `strftime` in [[Pandas]] to format dates for clear weekly labels.
- Organized and optimized [[Python]] code for data visualization, including moving function definitions outside loops and defining constants.
- Implemented horizontal line plotting in [[Matplotlib]] for better plot maintenance.
- Improved data visualization code readability and organization using Seaborn.
- Fixed date formatting for [[Matplotlib]] x-axis limits using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Rotated x-axis labels in Seaborn boxplots and generated comprehensive plots.
- Fitted a second-order polynomial to data using NumPy for predictive analysis.
- Exported food nutritional data to [[CSV]] using [[Pandas]].
- Developed functions to process [[CSV]] food data for macro calculations and meal planning.

### Achievements
- Successfully formatted dates and improved code organization for data visualization.
- Enhanced readability and maintainability of [[Python]] scripts for plotting.
- Achieved efficient processing of nutritional data for macro calculations and meal planning.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the meal planning function for more personalized diet recommendations.
