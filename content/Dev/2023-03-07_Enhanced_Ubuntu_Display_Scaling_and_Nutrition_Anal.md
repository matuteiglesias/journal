## 📅 2023-03-07 — Session: Enhanced Ubuntu Display Scaling and Nutrition Analysis

**🕒 04:15–05:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Ubuntu, Display Scaling, Python, Nutrition, Function Development  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to improve the display scaling settings in Ubuntu for better user experience and to enhance a [[Python]] function for nutritional analysis.

### Key Activities:
- **Ubuntu Display Scaling**: Adjusted the scaling factor of action and window bars in Ubuntu to suit higher resolutions. Troubleshot display scaling issues by upgrading the OS, installing GNOME Tweaks, and manually adjusting display resolution.
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Developed a [[Python]] function to find food substitutes based on nutritional values using Euclidean distance. Enhanced the function with a `max_distance` parameter for better filtering. Calculated nutritional values for skimmed milk, scaling from 100 ml to 1.5 L.

### Achievements:
- Successfully adjusted Ubuntu display settings to improve user interface on high-resolution screens.
- Enhanced the `find_substitutes` [[Python]] function with additional parameters for more precise nutritional analysis.
- Provided detailed nutritional calculations for skimmed milk.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the enhanced `find_substitutes` function to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
- Explore additional methods for optimizing Ubuntu display settings.
