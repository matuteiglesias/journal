## 📅 2023-03-08 — Session: Enhanced Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

**🕒 19:10–19:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Web Scraping, Beautifulsoup, Python, Html Parsing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The goal of this session was to refine and enhance web scraping capabilities using BeautifulSoup in [[Python]], focusing on extracting researcher data from [[HTML]] pages.

### Key Activities:
- Updated the CSS selector in BeautifulSoup code to use `:-soup-contains` instead of `:contains` to avoid warnings.
- Developed a [[Python]] function to scrape researcher and graduate student names, returning the data in a pandas DataFrame.
- Corrected a misspelled header tag from 'Reserchers' to 'Researchers' in the web scraping function.
- Addressed encoding issues by specifying character encoding manually in BeautifulSoup to ensure proper data parsing.
- Provided guidance on the correct URL for the Image Processing and Computer Vision Group's webpage.
- Suggested a workaround for a misspelling in the [[HTML]] code that affected data extraction.

### Achievements:
- Successfully updated and corrected web scraping scripts to handle CSS selector warnings, encoding issues, and [[HTML]] misspellings.
- Improved data extraction accuracy and reliability for researcher information.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the updated scripts on different [[HTML]] pages to ensure robustness.
- Verification of the correct URL for all relevant web pages to prevent future errors.
