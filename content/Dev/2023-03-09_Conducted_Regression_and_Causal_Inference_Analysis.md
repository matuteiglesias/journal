## 📅 2023-03-09 — Session: Conducted Regression and Causal Inference Analysis

**🕒 21:00–22:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Regression Analysis, Causal Inference, Mock Data, Data Visualization, Violence Data  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to conduct regression and causal inference analysis using mock datasets to explore biases, confounding variables, and the robustness of regression models.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a [[Python]] script for covariate analysis and visualization to compare focal and null areas.
- Generated a mock dataset for regression analysis, including treatment and control groups.
- Outlined a memo for documenting violence information outcomes, focusing on data quality and matching procedures.
- Assessed the quality of a violence information dataset, detailing data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Reviewed matching procedures and diagnosis notebooks to analyze the impact of infrastructure investment on violence outcomes.
- Conducted numerical tests with mock data to evaluate matching and regression methods for causal inference.
- Summarized findings from regression models for causal inference, highlighting biases and confounding variables.

**Achievements:**
- Completed the development of scripts and notebooks for regression and causal inference analysis.
- Documented the quality assessment of violence data and outlined further research steps.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further investigation into the implications of biases and confounding variables on regression models is needed.
- Continue exploring the impact of infrastructure investments on violence outcomes.
