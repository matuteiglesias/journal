**üïí 18:25‚Äì18:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Latex, Jupyter, Data Visualization, Africa, Conflict Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop and demonstrate methods for integrating LaTeX tables into [[Jupyter]] Notebooks, specifically for visualizing data on violent conflicts in Africa.

**Key Activities:**
- Created a structured LaTeX code example to summarize violent conflicts in Africa, covering details like countries, time periods, fatal victims, and displaced persons.
- Provided a code snippet for using the IPython display module to render LaTeX tables within [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.
- Explored the use of the `longtable` package for multi-page tables in [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.
- Demonstrated the usage of the LaTeX `tabular` environment for creating tables in [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.
- Offered guidance on inserting tables in Markdown cells of [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully integrated LaTeX table formatting into [[Jupyter]] Notebooks, enabling improved data visualization for conflict analysis.
- Clarified the limitations of UCDP and ACLED data in violence analysis, emphasizing the potential for incomplete data and unobserved factors.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of alternative data visualization methods to mitigate the limitations of current datasets.
