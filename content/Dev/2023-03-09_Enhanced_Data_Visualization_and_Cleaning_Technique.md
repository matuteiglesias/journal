## 📅 2023-03-09 — Session: Enhanced Data Visualization and Cleaning Techniques

**🕒 17:40–18:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Geospatial Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization and cleaning techniques using [[Python]], focusing on geospatial analysis, data cleaning, and conditional formatting.

### Key Activities
- **Mapping Violence Data in Africa**: Utilized matplotlib and geopandas to plot a map of Africa with violence data points.
- **Identifying Non-Integer Values**: Employed pandas to detect and handle non-integer values in a DataFrame.
- **Replacing NaN Values**: Used numpy to replace NaN values in arrays and convert data types.
- **Highlighting DataFrame Cells**: Implemented conditional formatting in pandas to highlight cells based on a threshold.

### Achievements
- Successfully plotted geospatial data on a map of Africa.
- Enhanced data cleaning processes by identifying and handling non-integer and NaN values.
- Improved data visualization by applying conditional formatting to DataFrames.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of resources for researching violent conflicts in Algeria, including databases like UCDP and ACLED.
