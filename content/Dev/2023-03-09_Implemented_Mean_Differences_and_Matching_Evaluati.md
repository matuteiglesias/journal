**üïí 20:10‚Äì20:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Analysis, Mean Differences, Treatment Effects, Empirical Studies  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to implement and refine [[Python]] code for calculating mean differences in treatment analysis and to evaluate the success of matching procedures in empirical studies.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a [[Python]] function to compute mean differences between treated and control units, focusing on efficiency by eliminating nested loops and highlighting matched units.
- Modified existing scripts to add a column indicating inclusion of all or matched units in mean difference calculations.
- Created a loop to display grouped tables of mean and standard deviation values by levels from the 'mean_diffs' DataFrame.
- Evaluated the effectiveness of matching procedures in reducing covariate differences, using statistical analysis to assess the success of these methods.
- Discussed the importance of covariate balance in empirical studies, including methods for comparing covariate means and implications for treatment effect attribution.
- Corrected syntax for saving figures in [[Python]] using [[Matplotlib]], with a focus on dynamic file naming using f-strings.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented and refined code for calculating mean differences and assessing matching procedures.
- Enhanced understanding of covariate balance and its implications for empirical research.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Conduct further sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness of the matching procedures and data quality checks.
