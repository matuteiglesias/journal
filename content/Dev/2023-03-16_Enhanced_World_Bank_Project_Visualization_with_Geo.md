## 📅 2023-03-16 — Session: Enhanced World Bank Project Visualization with GeoPandas

**🕒 21:25–21:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Geopandas, World Bank, Matplotlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the visualization of World Bank project locations using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]], GeoPandas, and [[Matplotlib]].

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a [[Python]] script to analyze World Bank project locations, counting unique geoname IDs and generating summary statistics.
- Updated visualization code to plot project locations on a world map, adjusting marker sizes and enhancing clarity with transparency and figure size adjustments.
- Implemented `FuncFormatter` to format legend labels as integers in [[Matplotlib]] plots.
- Corrected the use of `GeoDataFrame.plot()` for proper colorbar label formatting.
- Addressed a coding error by using `format_func` instead of `formatter` for legend label formatting.
- Utilized `fmtstring` in `legend_kwds` of GeoPandas to format legend bin edges without decimal places.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully enhanced the visualization of project locations with improved clarity and accurate legend formatting.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Review and test the updated visualization scripts for different datasets to ensure robustness and adaptability.
