### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to enhance skills in DataFrame manipulation and visualization using [[Python]]'s pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### Key Activities
- Created a DataFrame to track the presence of columns across multiple DataFrames using boolean values.
- Styled DataFrame cells based on boolean values, replacing them with 'Y' and 'N'.
- Concatenated multiple DataFrames and visualized unique value counts using grouped bar charts.
- Modified code to add an identifier for the originating dataset during concatenation and visualized data using grouped bar charts.
- Generated grouped bar charts with thin bars for better visual clarity.
- Used the `transform()` method for normalized counts in data visualization.
- Preprocessed DataFrames by replacing '#NULL!' with NaN and converting columns to numerical data.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented various techniques for DataFrame manipulation and visualization.
- Improved understanding of pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced visualization techniques for large datasets.
- [[Optimization]] of DataFrame processing for performance improvements.
