### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance file manipulation techniques in [[Python]], focusing on line removal, string extraction, and data parsing into [[JSON]] format.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Line Removal:** Debugged a [[Python]] function for removing specific lines from a file, enhancing it with print statements for better error tracking.
- **String Extraction:** Implemented a method to extract lines between specified strings in a file, including error handling for missing strings.
- **Data Parsing to [[JSON]]:** Developed a script to parse codebook information using regular expressions and convert it into [[JSON]] format.
- **Regex Modifications:** Adjusted regular expressions for specific codebook formats and explored alternative string manipulation techniques.
- **Special Character Removal:** Utilized the `replace()` method to remove special characters from text files.
- **File Overwriting:** Demonstrated overwriting file content post-special character removal.
- **Regex for File Filtering:** Modified regex patterns to filter lines starting with a digit followed by an equal sign.
- **Field Extraction to [[JSON]]:** Created a script to extract fields from text files and output them as [[JSON]] using regex.

### Achievements
Successfully developed and tested multiple [[Python]] scripts for file manipulation and data processing, improving error handling and regex usage.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of regex patterns for more complex file formats.
- [[Integration]] of these scripts into a larger data processing pipeline.
