## 📅 2023-03-23 — Session: Enhanced Python script for survey data parsing

**🕒 22:30–22:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, JSON, Data Parsing, Regular Expressions, Text Processing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to update and enhance [[Python]] scripts for parsing survey data from text files into [[JSON]] format.

### Key Activities
- Updated [[Python]] code to parse the 'Value Labels' field from a survey text file into [[JSON]] format, ensuring all content is captured as a single string.
- Modified the script to retain all lines of each field during text-to-[[JSON]] conversion, ensuring comprehensive data capture.
- Enhanced the script to process text files by extracting fields and values, grouping them by question numbers, and handling multiple values by storing them in lists.
- Implemented changes to specifically handle 'Value Labels' by concatenating values rather than appending them as a list.
- Modified the loop for field extraction to append consecutive lines to the value variable unless a new field name is detected.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated and refined [[Python]] scripts for effective survey data parsing and [[JSON]] conversion.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the modified scripts with diverse survey data sets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
