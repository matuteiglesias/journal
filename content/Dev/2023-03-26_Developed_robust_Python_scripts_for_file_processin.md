## üìÖ 2023-03-26 ‚Äî Session: Developed robust Python scripts for file processing

**üïí 15:55‚Äì16:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, File Handling, Error Handling, XML, Regex  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and enhance [[Python]] scripts for processing files, focusing on counting URLs, handling file encoding issues, and managing large XML files.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script to count URLs in files using regular expressions and the os module for directory traversal.
- Enhanced file reading capabilities by integrating the `chardet` library to detect file encoding and handle potential decoding errors.
- Improved error handling in the URL counting script to ensure robustness in cases of undetectable file encodings.
- Explored strategies for processing large XML files using the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module, focusing on streaming parsing and memory management.
- Explained the use of XML schemas and DTDs for XML document validation, providing code examples with [[Python]]'s xml.etree.ElementTree and xml.sax modules.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a robust URL counting script with enhanced error handling.
- Addressed file encoding challenges using the `chardet` library.
- Gained insights into efficient processing of large XML files and XML validation techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the XML processing strategies on different datasets to ensure scalability and performance.
