### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to enhance the visualization of choropleth maps using [[Python]], GeoPandas, and [[Matplotlib]] by customizing colorbars and improving the visual representation of geospatial data.

### Key Activities
- Customized the colorbar in choropleth maps by creating a separate axis and adjusting its properties.
- Fixed an error related to the `cax` argument in the `merged.plot()` function for choropleth maps.
- Developed dual choropleth maps to illustrate different funding sources with distinct color schemes.
- Implemented a custom color scale blending blue and red to visualize total funding by recipient for two entities, resulting in purple where overlaps occur.
- Modified scripts to remove colorbar legends from maps.
- Adjusted colorbar size and labeling for visual clarity in maps showing total funding by the World Bank and China.
- Loaded and projected GeoDataFrames using GeoJSON files and demonstrated map projection changes using the Robinson projection.

### Achievements
- Successfully customized and enhanced the visual representation of choropleth maps.
- Resolved coding errors and improved the clarity of data visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced color scales and their impact on data interpretation.
- [[Optimization]] of map projection techniques for different geospatial datasets.
