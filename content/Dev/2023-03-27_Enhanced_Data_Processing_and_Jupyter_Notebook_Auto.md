**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to improve data processing techniques and automate the conversion of [[Jupyter]] notebooks to different formats.

### Key Activities:
- Conducted a comparison between old and new versions of data processing code, focusing on improvements like merging with country shapes and creating unique project location identifiers.
- Modified DataFrames using [[Pandas]] and GeoPandas to explode geographical columns and include new calculated columns such as `even_split_totalamt`.
- Cleaned DataFrame columns by removing commas and converting strings to floats.
- Automated the conversion of [[Jupyter]] notebooks to PDF and [[HTML]] formats using command-line tools like `jupyter nbconvert` and `find`, excluding checkpoint files.
- Utilized Unix command history to efficiently locate and reuse `nbconvert` commands.

### Achievements:
- Successfully refactored data processing code to enhance functionality and clarity.
- Implemented automation scripts for converting [[Jupyter]] notebooks, improving workflow efficiency.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the new data processing code to ensure robustness.
- Explore additional automation opportunities for other data formats or environments.
