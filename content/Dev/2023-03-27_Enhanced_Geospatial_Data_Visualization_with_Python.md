**🕒 08:30–08:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Code Improvement, Data Visualization, Geopandas, Plotly, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance code clarity and improve data visualization techniques for geospatial and funding analysis.

### Key Activities
- Improved code clarity by adding descriptive comments and renaming columns in GeoDataFrames for better readability.
- Outlined effective data visualization techniques for funding analysis using various plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, choropleth maps, and bubble charts.
- Provided example code for creating a choropleth map using GeoPandas and [[Matplotlib]] to visualize World Bank funding by country.
- Modified Plotly plot layout parameters and added traces for World Bank and China projects.
- Resolved a common error in [[Python]] by importing the correct module from Plotly.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the clarity and informativeness of geospatial analysis code.
- Successfully implemented data visualization techniques for funding analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore and implement additional data visualization techniques for comprehensive analysis.
- Investigate more features of the Go programming language for potential future use.
