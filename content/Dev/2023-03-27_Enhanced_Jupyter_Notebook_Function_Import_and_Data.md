## 📅 2023-03-27 — Session: Enhanced Jupyter Notebook Function Import and DataFrame Handling

**🕒 06:45–07:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Jupyter, Python, Pandas, Dataframe, Function Import  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the process of importing functions across [[Jupyter]] notebooks and improve DataFrame handling in [[Python]] using [[Pandas]].

### Key Activities
- Explored methods for importing functions defined in one [[Jupyter]] notebook into another, including setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
- Provided a step-by-step guide for using the `aggregate_csv` function from the `data_process.py` module.
- Addressed a DataFrame column not found error by suggesting checks for typos and proper loading.
- Demonstrated efficient data manipulation techniques in [[Pandas]], such as converting 'date' and 'datetime' columns to datetime objects and creating a new 'year' column.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up the environment for function imports in [[Jupyter]] notebooks.
- Clarified the process of handling datetime columns in [[Pandas]], optimizing DataFrame manipulation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of error handling techniques for DataFrame operations to prevent common issues like missing columns.
