**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance file search techniques using command line tools and improve the calculation of the 'TimePeriod' column in a DataFrame.

**Key Activities:**
- Explored the use of `find` and `grep` commands to locate files with specific substrings in their names.
- Demonstrated the use of `grep` for searching function definitions and specific file types, including `.ipynb` and `.py` files, with extended regular expressions.
- Compared two code versions for computing the `TimePeriod` column, analyzing different methods for calculating `Period` and `TimePeriod` columns.
- Provided a modified code snippet for the 'TimePeriod' calculation, retaining an alternative method for min/max year computation.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully demonstrated advanced file search techniques using command line tools.
- Clarified differences in code versions for `TimePeriod` calculation and provided an improved method.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the modified `TimePeriod` calculation method to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
