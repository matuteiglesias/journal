## 📅 2023-03-27 — Session: Implemented Dynamic Path Handling in Python Scripts

**🕒 19:55–20:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Dynamic Paths, File Handling, Geospatial Data  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to enhance [[Python]] scripts by implementing dynamic path handling, ensuring compatibility across different user environments and platforms.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed methods to dynamically set paths for various data files (GADM, ACLED, DHS) using [[Python]] libraries such as `getpass`, `os`, and `pathlib`.
- Improved code snippets for reading and writing geospatial data (GeoJSON, shapefiles) with libraries like GeoPandas and [[Matplotlib]].
- Utilized the `glob` function for locating notebook files and implemented error handling.
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility by replacing hard-coded paths with user-specific directories.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created dynamic path solutions for multiple file types, enhancing code flexibility and user adaptability.
- Improved data processing and visualization scripts, making them more robust and easier to maintain.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the implemented code snippets across different operating systems to ensure full compatibility.
- [[Documentation]] update to reflect changes in path handling methods.
