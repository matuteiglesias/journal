**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to implement and troubleshoot the `geodesic_point_buffer` function in [[Python]], focusing on geospatial analysis using PyProj and Shapely libraries.

### Key Activities:
- Imported necessary [[Python]] modules for geospatial operations, including `pyproj`, `shapely.geometry`, and `functools`.
- Addressed import errors and guided the resolution of missing function errors related to the `geodesic_point_buffer` function.
- Completed the function definition, ensuring proper error handling and resolving issues with missing function bodies.
- Updated deprecated `pyproj` functions by utilizing the `pyproj.CRS` class to handle FutureWarnings.
- Emphasized the importance of importing the `partial` function from `functools` for use within the function.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented the `geodesic_point_buffer` function with appropriate imports and error handling.
- Resolved import and function definition errors, ensuring the function works as intended.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the `geodesic_point_buffer` function to ensure robustness and accuracy in various geospatial scenarios.
