**üïí 07:25‚Äì07:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Error Handling, Code Correction, Troubleshooting  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve specific errors in [[Python]] code related to the `map` function and `join` method, and to troubleshoot import and file path issues.

### Key Activities
- **Error Fixing:** Addressed errors caused by using the `map` function on an integer and within the `join` method. Provided corrected lines of code to resolve these issues.
- **Year Calculation:** Implemented a [[Python]] code snippet to find the first year after 2000 that is a multiple of a given integer T.
- **Import Error [[Troubleshooting]]:** Investigated common causes of import errors for the `aggregate_csv_GID` function, including function definition issues and import path problems.
- **File Path [[Troubleshooting]]:** Provided guidance on checking and correcting file paths in [[Python]] scripts.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed errors in the use of the `map` function and `join` method.
- Developed a working solution to calculate years based on multiples.
- Identified potential causes for import errors and provided solutions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the corrected code snippets in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Additional exploration of file path issues in complex directory structures.
