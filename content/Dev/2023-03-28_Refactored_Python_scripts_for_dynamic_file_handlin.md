## 📅 2023-03-28 — Session: Refactored Python scripts for dynamic file handling

**🕒 00:00–00:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, File Handling, Refactoring, Error Handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refactor [[Python]] scripts to improve file path handling, ensuring portability and flexibility across different environments and user accounts.

### Key Activities
- Implemented checks for DataFrame column existence to handle data validation gracefully.
- Refactored DCF scripts to remove hardcoded paths, using relative paths based on the script's location.
- Utilized the `os` module to access the current user's home directory and dynamically retrieve usernames for flexible file path construction.
- Constructed file paths for DHS data and other files, ensuring compatibility across systems.
- Addressed an issue with an undefined `DictionaryParser` object by checking imports and installations.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored scripts to use dynamic file paths, enhancing script portability.
- Improved error handling and data validation processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Verify the integration of the refactored scripts in production environments to ensure seamless operation.
- Further investigate the `DictionaryParser` issue if it persists after initial troubleshooting.
