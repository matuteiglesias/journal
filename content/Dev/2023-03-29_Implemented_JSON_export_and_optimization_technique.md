## üìÖ 2023-03-29 ‚Äî Session: Implemented JSON export and optimization techniques

**üïí 21:30‚Äì21:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, JSON, Data Processing, Optimization, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to implement and optimize techniques for exporting data to [[JSON]] format using [[Python]], specifically focusing on grouping data and improving performance.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed [[Python]] code snippets to group datasets by variable and year, creating nested dictionary structures for [[JSON]] export.
- Explored methods to optimize data writing speed, including the use of efficient file formats and distributed computing frameworks.
- Implemented efficient dictionary creation from grouped DataFrames using the `to_dict` method, enhancing performance.
- Provided instructions on loading [[JSON]] files into [[Pandas]] DataFrames, optimizing memory usage by setting columns as categorical data types.
- Addressed [[JSON]] formatting errors, offering guidance on debugging with `json.loads()`.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created and exported nested dictionaries to [[JSON]] format.
- Enhanced data writing performance through optimized techniques.
- Improved data manipulation efficiency in [[Pandas]].

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of distributed computing frameworks for large-scale data processing.
