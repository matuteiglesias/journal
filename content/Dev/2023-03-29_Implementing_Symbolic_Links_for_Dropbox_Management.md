### Session Goal:
The session aimed to explore and implement symbolic links for efficient file management and synchronization between local directories and Dropbox, as well as to organize data science projects for improved collaboration.

### Key Activities:
- Detailed instructions were provided on linking shared folders in Dropbox using both Linux and the Dropbox web interface.
- Steps to create symbolic links for file synchronization between local directories and Dropbox were executed, with a focus on using command-line tools like `ln`.
- Addressed troubleshooting of symbolic links and file visibility issues in Dropbox.
- Discussed the organization of data science projects using [[Jupyter]] notebooks to enhance collaboration and reproducibility.

### Achievements:
- Successfully created symbolic links to synchronize files between local and Dropbox directories.
- Clarified the structure and organization of research projects for data-intensive analysis of social phenomena.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of troubleshooting techniques for symbolic links in Dropbox.
- Additional refinement of project organization strategies for data science projects.
