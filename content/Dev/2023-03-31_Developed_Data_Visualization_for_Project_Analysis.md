**🕒 18:05–18:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Visualization, Python, Matplotlib, Bar Chart, Error Handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The objective of this session was to enhance data visualization techniques for analyzing project data from Chinese and World Bank sources.

### Key Activities:
- Developed and modified [[Python]] code snippets to create stacked and grouped bar charts using [[Matplotlib]].
- Focused on visualizing the number of projects and total funding by administrative area and year.
- Implemented solutions for common visualization issues such as rotating x-axis labels and fixing mismatched tick locations.
- Updated code for improved aesthetics, including wider bars and better labeling.

### Achievements:
- Successfully generated various bar plots to compare project data across different dimensions.
- Addressed and corrected errors in plotting code to ensure accurate data representation.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further refinement of visualization aesthetics and exploration of additional data dimensions could be considered in future sessions.
