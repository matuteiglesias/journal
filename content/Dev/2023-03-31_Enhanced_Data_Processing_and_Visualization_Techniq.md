## 📅 2023-03-31 — Session: Enhanced Data Processing and Visualization Techniques

**🕒 18:35–18:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Geopandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance data processing and visualization capabilities using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]].

**Key Activities:**
- Replaced commas and converted data types in DataFrame columns using [[Pandas]].
- Converted DataFrame sums to billions and formatted them to one decimal place.
- Created histograms for multiple DataFrames using [[Matplotlib]], including normalization of bins.
- Developed a unified function to compare DataFrames, handling NaN values and providing a lower triangular matrix of common IDs.
- Analyzed project ID overlaps and date distributions across datasets.
- Loaded GeoJSON files into GeoDataFrames using GeoPandas for geospatial analysis.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented data cleaning and conversion techniques in [[Pandas]].
- Enhanced data visualization methods with [[Matplotlib]] for better insights.
- Improved DataFrame comparison functions to handle NaN values effectively.
- Gained insights into project ID overlaps and date distributions through data analysis.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further explore advanced data visualization techniques for geospatial data.
- Investigate additional methods for handling missing data in DataFrame comparisons.
