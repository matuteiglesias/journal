**üïí 18:20‚Äì19:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Jupyter, Markdown, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data processing workflows using [[Python]], focusing on converting [[Jupyter]] notebooks to Markdown, data cleaning, and file handling operations.

### Key Activities
- Converted [[Jupyter]] notebooks to Markdown format, ensuring proper formatting with escaped code blocks.
- Introduced a Data Cleaning Notebook designed for processing electoral data, detailing its structure and functionalities.
- Provided [[Python]] code snippets for converting DataFrame column names to lowercase using pandas.
- Demonstrated methods for storing and reading dictionaries in [[JSON]] and [[CSV]] formats.
- Modified [[Python]] code for transforming [[CSV]] data by adding file tag columns and saving the results.
- Showcased data transformation and merging techniques using pandas for handling multiple [[CSV]] files.
- Discussed optimizing data grouping in pandas using the `groupby` function.
- Provided a code snippet for modifying data grouping and extracting modal values within a DataFrame.
- Gave an example of saving a [[Python]] dictionary to a [[JSON]] file using the json module.

### Achievements
- Successfully converted [[Jupyter]] notebooks to Markdown.
- Enhanced understanding of data cleaning processes for electoral data.
- Improved data manipulation skills using pandas for DataFrame operations.
- Gained proficiency in file handling and serialization with [[JSON]] and [[CSV]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced data manipulation techniques in pandas.
- Implementation of the data cleaning notebook in real-world electoral data scenarios.
