**🕒 16:55–17:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Github, Automation, Git, Script, Credentials  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the automation of GitHub repository management by refining scripts and configurations.

### Key Activities
- Confirmed the functionality of an automation script for committing and pushing changes to GitHub.
- Provided instructions for adding untracked files to [[Git]] repositories and automating these processes using [[Git]] commands.
- Updated the `autopush.sh` script to utilize `git status --porcelain` for detecting changes, including untracked files.
- Configured [[Git]] user information and credentials for seamless repository access.
- Explored methods for caching [[Git]] credentials to prevent repeated authentication prompts.
- Addressed and corrected errors in [[Git]] configuration commands, particularly for setting the user email.
- Implemented GitHub authentication using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) to replace deprecated password methods.

### Achievements
- Successfully automated the detection and committing of changes, including untracked files, using an updated script.
- Enhanced [[Git]] credential management through caching and configuration corrections.
- Transitioned to using Personal Access Tokens for GitHub authentication, improving security and compliance.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated `autopush.sh` script in various scenarios to ensure robustness.
- Monitor for any additional errors or issues in [[Git]] configuration and automation processes.
