**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary aim of this session was to enhance [[Git]] operations by automating repository management using Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for authentication.

**Key Activities:**
- Configured [[Git]] to use a personal access token directly in the remote URL, avoiding the need for username prompts.
- Modified GitHub repository URLs in the `repositories.txt` file to include a PAT, thus improving security by eliminating the need for username and password prompts.
- Developed a script to automate cloning and updating multiple [[Git]] repositories by integrating PATs into the repository URLs. This script checks for existing directories, pulls changes if they exist, and commits any local changes before pushing them back to the remote repository.
- Corrected a Bash script for managing [[Git]] repositories, improving syntax for the `sed` command and updating variable assignment methods for better readability.
- Provided a corrected syntax for string substitution in a Bash script to substitute a URL with a PAT.
- Explained bash parameter substitution for inserting a PAT into a GitHub URL for authentication when pushing changes to a remote repository.
- Addressed an error related to the use of the '<<<' redirection operator in a sed command, suggesting a workaround using echo and a pipe for compatibility with shells that do not support 'here strings'.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully automated [[Git]] operations using PATs, enhancing security and efficiency in repository management.
- Improved the robustness and compatibility of Bash scripts used in [[Git]] operations.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the automated script across different environments to ensure compatibility and robustness.
- [[Documentation]] of the script and its usage for future reference.
