**🕒 18:25–18:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Git, Credential Manager, Linux, Configuration, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to configure the [[Git]] Credential Manager (GCM) on a Linux system to streamline GitHub repository interactions by caching credentials.

### Key Activities
- **Credential Caching Setup**: Initiated the configuration of [[Git]] to cache credentials using [[Git]] Credential Manager (GCM).
- **Manual Installation**: Conducted a manual installation of GCM after an automated attempt failed.
- **File Verification**: Verified the format of the `gcmcore-linux.tar.gz` file and addressed issues with incorrect file identification.
- **[[Configuration]] and Testing**: Configured GCM with username and personal access token, and tested the installation by performing [[Git]] operations.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolved potential conflicts in [[Git]] credential configurations and ensured proper installation and functionality.
- **[[Automation]]**: Used a `find` command to unset the `credential.helper` setting across multiple repositories.

### Achievements
- Successfully configured and tested the [[Git]] Credential Manager on Linux.
- Resolved file format issues and credential configuration conflicts.

### Pending Tasks
- Rerun the autopush script to verify credential prompts and ensure all configurations are correctly applied.
