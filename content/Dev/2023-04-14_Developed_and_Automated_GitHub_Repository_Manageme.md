**üïí 04:00‚Äì05:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Github, Automation, Scripting, Python, Bash  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance and automate the management of GitHub repositories using both [[Python]] and Bash scripting.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Wiz Light WiFi Connectivity Issues**: Initial steps involved resolving connectivity issues with smart home devices, which was not directly related to the main goal.
- **Listing GitHub Repositories**: Explored methods to list GitHub repositories using both the GitHub profile page and [[API]].
- **[[Python]] Script Development**: Created and corrected a [[Python]] script to fetch and list GitHub repositories, handling [[JSON]] parsing errors and implementing [[API]] pagination.
- **Bash Scripting for [[Git]] Management**: Developed and refined Bash scripts to automate cloning, updating, and managing [[Git]] repositories, ensuring no overwriting of existing directories.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed scripts in [[Python]] and Bash to automate the management of GitHub repositories, including fetching, cloning, updating, and handling local changes.
- Addressed and resolved [[JSON]] parsing errors in the [[Python]] script, ensuring robust [[API]] integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the Bash scripts for handling edge cases in repository management.
- [[Integration]] of error handling mechanisms in the scripts for improved reliability.
