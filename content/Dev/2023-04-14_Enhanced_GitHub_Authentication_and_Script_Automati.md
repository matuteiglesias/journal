### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance GitHub authentication processes and automate [[Git]] push commands by correcting errors and configuring credential management.

### Key Activities
- **Corrected [[Git]] Push Command Syntax:** Replaced the incorrect '-c' option with '--config' to prevent script errors.
- **Configured [[Git]] Credential Helper:** Set up a `.git-credentials` file and configured [[Git]] to use it for seamless authentication.
- **Modified autopush.sh Script:** Updated the script to utilize the `~/.git-credentials` for GitHub authentication.
- **Troubleshot Authentication Errors:** Addressed 'Invalid username or password' errors by focusing on personal access tokens and remote repository settings.

### Achievements
- Successfully configured [[Git]] credential management for automated GitHub authentication.
- Corrected script syntax errors, enhancing automation reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Verify the new configuration in different environments to ensure consistent behavior.
- Explore additional automation opportunities using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
