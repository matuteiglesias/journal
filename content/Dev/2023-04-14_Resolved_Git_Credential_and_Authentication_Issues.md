### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve [[Git]] credential and authentication issues that were preventing successful push operations to a [[Git]] repository.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] [[Git]] Push Credential Issues:** Explored steps to resolve [[Git]] prompting for a username during push operations by checking stored credentials and editing the `.git-credentials` file.
- **Pushing Changes to Repository:** Successfully pushed changes to a [[Git]] repository after configuring the Personal Access Token.
- **Authentication [[Troubleshooting]]:** Addressed authentication problems by erasing stored credentials and using a trace command to prompt for new credentials.
- **Retrieving and Viewing Credentials:** Used `git credential-store list` to view stored credentials and retrieve passwords for specific hosts.
- **Credential Store Setup:** Configured [[Git]] credentials using the `credential-store` helper, including command usage and manual file setup.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Credential Store Command:** Addressed issues with the `git credential-store` command by checking file permissions and creating the credentials file if missing.
- **Storing GitHub Credentials:** Explained how to store GitHub credentials in the `.git-credentials` file manually or using the `git credential-store` command.
- **Fixing Credential Store Issues:** Provided steps to manually create a `.git-credentials` file to address issues with the `git credential-store` command.
- **Credential Helper [[Configuration]]:** Configured [[Git]] credential storage using the `-c` option in the `git push` command to address unsupported options.
- **Corrected [[Git]] Command:** Offered a corrected command to push changes while storing credentials, addressing syntax errors.
- **Credential Helper Issues Resolution:** Suggested using a global configuration and proper file permissions for the credentials file to resolve issues.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[Git]] credential and authentication issues, enabling smooth push operations to the repository.
- Configured [[Git]] to store credentials securely, improving workflow efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and test the global configuration changes in different environments to ensure consistency.
- Monitor for any recurring issues with credential storage and address promptly.
