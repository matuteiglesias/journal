- Provided a guide on creating and running R notebooks in VS Code, including the installation of the R extension and exporting notebooks as [[HTML]].
- Configured the R executable path in VS Code's `settings.json` to resolve configuration errors.
- Installed R and R Markdown extensions in Visual Studio Code to enhance R programming capabilities and troubleshoot display issues with Rmd files.
- Explained how to find the R installation path using terminal commands.

### Achievements
- Successfully configured the R environment in Visual Studio Code, enabling the creation and execution of R notebooks and scripts.
- Resolved configuration issues related to the R path and R Markdown file display in VS Code.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the R environment setup to ensure stability and performance.
- Exploration of additional VS Code extensions that may enhance R programming workflows.
