**🕒 20:40–21:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Beautifulsoup, Web Scraping, Error Handling, Dataframe  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to implement a robust web scraping solution using BeautifulSoup to extract news articles from a specified website and handle potential errors effectively.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a [[Python]] script using BeautifulSoup and pandas to scrape news articles and store them in a DataFrame.
- Implemented error handling to manage missing data for article titles, sections, authors, and dates by assigning `None` when values are not available.
- Used try-except blocks to handle cases where article titles or dates may be missing.
- Integrated conditional checks to avoid errors when accessing attributes in BeautifulSoup.
- Added a column for 'href' in the DataFrame and set default values when elements are missing.
- Explored the use of Selenium for scraping dynamically loaded content and discussed legal and ethical considerations.
- Addressed potential gaierror issues by ensuring valid URLs are used in web scraping.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created a web scraping script with comprehensive error handling and data integration into a pandas DataFrame.
- Enhanced understanding of handling dynamic content with Selenium.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of Selenium for dynamic content scraping and legal considerations.
- Testing the script on different websites to ensure robustness.
