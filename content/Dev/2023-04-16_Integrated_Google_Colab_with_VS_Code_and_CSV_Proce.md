## üìÖ 2023-04-16 ‚Äî Session: Integrated Google Colab with VS Code and CSV Processing

**üïí 21:40‚Äì22:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, Python, Pandas, Csv Processing, Regex  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore integration techniques between Google Colab and Visual Studio Code, and to enhance [[CSV]] file processing using [[Python]]'s pandas library.

### Key Activities
- **[[Integration]] Insight**: Discussed the integration of Google Colab and Visual Studio Code, highlighting extensions that facilitate enhanced coding workflows.
- **[[CSV]] Processing with [[Pandas]]**: Provided a step-by-step guide and code snippets for reading and processing [[CSV]] files using pandas, focusing on selecting specific columns and looping through multiple files.
- **Regex for [[Data Extraction]]**: Demonstrated the use of regular expressions to extract roots from variable names in [[CSV]] files, including error handling and pattern modifications to ensure robustness.
- **Data Manipulation**: Showcased techniques for filtering and saving [[CSV]] data, converting roots to lowercase, and concatenating geographic columns in a DataFrame.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated Google Colab with Visual Studio Code for improved coding workflows.
- Developed robust [[Python]] scripts for [[CSV]] file processing, including error handling and regex-based data extraction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced integration features between Google Colab and Visual Studio Code.
- [[Optimization]] of [[CSV]] processing scripts for larger datasets.
