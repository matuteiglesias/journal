### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve GitHub authentication issues due to the removal of password authentication and to update [[Git]] remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH for enhanced security.

### Key Activities
- Addressed the GitHub authentication error by exploring alternatives such as personal access tokens and SSH keys.
- Provided instructions for updating [[Git]] remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH, ensuring secure connections.
- Resolved an SSH authentication issue by updating the remote URL and advised updating other local clones.
- Developed a Bash script to automate the modification of [[Git]] remote URLs and manage repository operations, including pulling, committing, and pushing changes.
- Addressed errors related to executing [[Git]] commands outside of a repository and provided solutions for correct directory navigation.
- Debugged a shell script to identify problematic directories and ensure proper execution of [[Git]] commands.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved GitHub authentication issues and transitioned to using SSH keys.
- Updated [[Git]] remote URLs for enhanced security and streamlined repository management.
- Automated the process of updating remote URLs and managing [[Git]] operations across multiple repositories.

### Pending Tasks
- Ensure all local clones are updated with the new SSH remote URLs.
- Further testing of the Bash script in different environments to ensure robustness.
