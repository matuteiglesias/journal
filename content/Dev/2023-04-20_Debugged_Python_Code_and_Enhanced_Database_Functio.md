## 📅 2023-04-20 — Session: Debugged Python Code and Enhanced Database Functions

**🕒 19:35–19:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Debugging, Database, SQL, Functional Dependencies  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug [[Python]] code, generate SQL queries from DataFrame columns, and enhance database functions for handling functional dependencies.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] [[Python]] Code**: Addressed indentation issues in the `is_prime_attribute` function by checking the `if` statement within the `for` loop.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Demonstrated creating an SQL query string using column names from a DataFrame with [[Python]]'s list comprehension and string formatting.
- **Database Function Definitions**: Implemented the `find_superkey` function to identify superkeys using functional dependencies and attribute closure.
- **Functional Dependency [[Optimization]]**: Defined functions `decompose_fds`, `remove_extraneous_attributes`, and `remove_redundant_fds` to optimize functional dependencies.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Developed the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of a given set using binary representation.
- **SQLite Schema Querying**: Used [[Python]]'s `sqlite3` library to retrieve schema information from an SQLite database.
- **Hashability Fix**: Resolved hashability issues in attribute closures by converting sets to frozensets for dictionary keys.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged [[Python]] code related to indentation.
- Enhanced understanding and implementation of SQL query generation from DataFrame columns.
- Implemented and refined database functions for better handling of functional dependencies.
- Improved hashability in attribute closures, ensuring robust database function performance.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented database functions in real-world scenarios.
- Exploration of additional optimization techniques for functional dependencies.
