## üìÖ 2023-04-20 ‚Äî Session: Developed and Corrected Python Data Extraction Code

**üïí 22:40‚Äì23:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Extraction, Code Correction, Data Management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to develop and correct [[Python]] code snippets for extracting values from strings in a list, focusing on data extraction and processing techniques.

### Key Activities
- Developed initial [[Python]] code snippets to extract values following the 'Nombre: ' label from a list of strings using for loops and string manipulation.
- Corrected and refined the code to improve accuracy and efficiency, ensuring the extracted values are stored in a new list.
- Explored techniques for identifying minimal composite keys in datasets to ensure data integrity.
- Implemented methods to identify minimal subsets of columns for data deduplication using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].
- Demonstrated how to find intersections between DataFrame columns and predefined lists using [[Pandas]].

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and corrected [[Python]] code for extracting values from strings, demonstrating practical data parsing and processing solutions.
- Clarified the process of identifying minimal composite keys and subsets for data deduplication, enhancing data management skills.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced data manipulation techniques and optimization of existing code snippets for better performance.
