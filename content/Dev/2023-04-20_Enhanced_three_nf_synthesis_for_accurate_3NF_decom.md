## üìÖ 2023-04-20 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced three_nf_synthesis for accurate 3NF decomposition

**üïí 20:30‚Äì20:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: 3NF, Functional Dependencies, Python, Debugging, Database  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to address issues in the `three_nf_synthesis` function related to incorrect column names during 3NF decomposition, and to improve understanding and handling of functional dependencies in database relations.

### Key Activities:
- **Function Fix**: Proposed a modification to the `three_nf_synthesis` function to accept DataFrame column names as an argument, ensuring accurate decomposition.
- **[[Debugging]]**: Identified and addressed an undefined variable `F` in the coding context.
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Explored the concept of functional dependencies in database relations and their importance in 3NF decomposition.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Discussed methods for inferring functional dependencies using Armstrong's axioms with a [[Python]] implementation.
- **Library Utilization**: Demonstrated the use of the `combinations` function from [[Python]]'s `itertools` module to generate column pairs from a DataFrame.
- **Tool Introduction**: Provided a guide for using SQLite Studio for managing and querying databases.

### Achievements:
- Developed a clear plan to modify the `three_nf_synthesis` function for better accuracy in 3NF decomposition.
- Enhanced understanding of functional dependencies and their application in database design.

### Pending Tasks:
- Implement and test the proposed changes to the `three_nf_synthesis` function.
- Define the variable `F` and ensure its correct usage in the code.
- Further explore methods for identifying functional dependencies in various data contexts.
