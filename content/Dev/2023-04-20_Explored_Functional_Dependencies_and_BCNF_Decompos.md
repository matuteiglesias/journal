**üïí 15:10‚Äì17:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, BCNF, Functional Dependencies, Database Design, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the concepts of functional dependencies and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) decomposition in database design, focusing on practical implementations using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Reviewed [[Python]] tools for detecting relationships in [[CSV]] files and constructing relational database schemas.
- Explored the concept of closure of attributes in functional dependencies and its application in online shopping and data warehousing.
- Analyzed customer orders using pandas to project functional dependencies.
- Implemented and explained the BCNF decomposition algorithm in [[Python]], including a modified lossless version.
- Discussed the use of libraries like `pydeequ`, `pdvega`, and `py_entitymatching` for schema inference and normalization checks.
- Provided code examples for BCNF decomposition using SQL and pandas, and demonstrated the implementation of functions for checking prime attributes and computing attribute closures.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented BCNF decomposition algorithms in [[Python]], ensuring data integrity through lossless decomposition.
- Clarified the mathematical proof of attribute closure and its implications in database normalization.
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of functional dependencies and their role in database design.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of 4NF verification and decomposition techniques to address multi-valued dependencies.
- Consideration of additional [[Python]] libraries for advanced database normalization and schema inference.
