## 📅 2023-04-20 — Session: Resolved SQL and Python database integration issues

**🕒 20:10–20:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, SQL, Database, Error Handling, Connection Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to address and resolve various issues related to database management using SQL and [[Python]], focusing on table decomposition, error handling, and connection management.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented [[Python]] code for decomposing tables in a database, using the `cursor.execute()` method to create and insert data into new tables.
- Resolved an SQL table name error by converting a frozen set object to a string for `CREATE TABLE` statements.
- Managed conflicts with existing database tables by providing solutions for dropping or renaming tables.
- Retrieved column names from an R table using SQL and [[Python]], facilitating data manipulation.
- Corrected the creation of an SQLite table from a DataFrame by ensuring correct column names and data insertion.
- Addressed database connection errors by ensuring cursors are created before closing connections.
- Discussed best practices for maintaining active database connections to prevent premature closure issues.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully decomposed database tables and resolved SQL table name errors.
- Improved database management practices by handling existing table conflicts and optimizing connection management.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the implemented solutions to ensure robustness in different database environments.
