## 📅 2023-04-25 — Session: Implemented Pandas DataFrame Boolean Count Logic

**🕒 14:00–14:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, Data Analysis, Python, Dataframe, Boolean Logic  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement efficient data analysis techniques using [[Pandas]] to count occurrences of boolean column values in a DataFrame.

### Key Activities
- Utilized the `groupby` method in [[Pandas]] to group data by boolean columns and count projects with scores above 0.5.
- Created a DataFrame to store counts of projects with scores above 0.5 for specified boolean columns.
- Updated code to replace the deprecated `.append()` method with `pd.concat()` for data aggregation.
- Developed logic to count projects with scores above a threshold for columns starting with 'ad_sector_names_' or 'mjsector_'.
- Calculated counts and percentages of projects with scores above and below 0.5 for specified boolean columns.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a robust method to count and analyze boolean column data in [[Pandas]].
- Transitioned from using `.append()` to `pd.concat()` ensuring compatibility with future [[Pandas]] versions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the code for performance improvements in large datasets.
- Validation of results with real-world data to ensure accuracy.
