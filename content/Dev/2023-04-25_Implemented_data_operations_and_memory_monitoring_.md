**üïí 18:50‚Äì19:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Operations, Memory Management, Vs Code, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to implement various data operations in [[Python]] and explore methods for monitoring memory usage.

### Key Activities:
- **Code Evaluation Request:** Initiated a request for code submission for evaluation purposes.
- **Union Operation for Relations:** Implemented the union operation on two relations, R and S, with functions for initialization, tuple retrieval, and closure of relations.
- **Data Operations in [[Python]]:** Developed [[Python]] classes for data operations such as Projection, Distinct, Grouping, Set Union, Set Intersection, and Set Difference using custom iterators.
- **Memory Usage in [[Pandas]]:** Explained how to monitor memory usage in [[Pandas]] DataFrames using the `memory_usage()` method and `pandas.api.types` module.
- **Real-Time Memory Monitoring:** Outlined methods for real-time memory monitoring in [[Python]] using tools like memory_profiler, objgraph, and pympler, and discussed OS tools like top and htop.
- **VS Code Extensions:** Listed extensions for Visual Studio Code to monitor and optimize memory usage in [[Python]] applications.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented several data operations with custom iterators in [[Python]].
- Clarified methods for monitoring memory usage in [[Python]] applications and [[Pandas]] DataFrames.
- Identified useful VS Code extensions for memory management.

### Pending Tasks:
- Submit code for evaluation as initially requested.
