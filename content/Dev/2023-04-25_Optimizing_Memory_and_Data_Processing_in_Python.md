**üïí 20:15‚Äì22:46**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Vs Code, Memory Optimization, Data Processing, Pandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore tools and techniques for optimizing memory usage in [[Python]] applications, particularly within the Visual Studio Code environment, and to enhance data processing workflows using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- **Memory Monitoring in VS Code**: Reviewed and listed several Visual Studio Code extensions for real-time memory monitoring, including alternatives for the unavailable Memory Monitor extension.
- **Pylance Setup**: Provided instructions for installing and configuring Pylance in VS Code to improve [[Python]] development with type checking and code analysis.
- **Data Normalization and Processing**: Summarized an algorithm for data normalization and implemented [[Python]] functions for decomposing dataframes into [[CSV]] files, modifying file paths, and harmonizing names across datasets.
- **Performance Measurement**: Explained the use of [[Jupyter]] magic commands `%%time` and `%timeit` for performance measurement of code execution.
- **Process Management in Linux**: Offered guidance on using the `kill` command to terminate processes in Linux.

### Achievements
- Identified and documented key VS Code extensions for memory optimization.
- Successfully set up and utilized Pylance for [[Python]] development.
- Implemented and tested various data processing functions in [[Python]], enhancing data management capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of memory optimization techniques and tools for [[Python]] applications.
- Continued refinement and testing of data processing scripts to ensure robustness and efficiency.
