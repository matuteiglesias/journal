## 📅 2023-04-27 — Session: Executed SSH and Yarn-based development tasks

**🕒 23:30–23:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: SSH, Yarn, Web Development, Command Line, Eleventy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to execute and understand various software development tasks related to remote server access, directory management, and web project build processes.

### Key Activities
- **SSH Access**: Reviewed and executed SSH login instructions to ensure secure server access.
- **Directory Management**: Renamed a directory using the `mv` command to streamline file organization.
- **Web Project Builds**: Explored build steps in web projects by examining the `package.json` file and understanding the scripts for development and production builds using Eleventy.
- **Yarn Utilization**: Verified Yarn installation, ran a development server, and resolved a lockfile error by updating dependencies with `yarn install`.

### Achievements
- Successfully accessed a server via SSH.
- Renamed directories efficiently using command line tools.
- Gained a clear understanding of web project build processes and the role of `package.json` scripts.
- Ensured Yarn was properly installed and operational, resolving a critical lockfile error.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced SSH features and remote server management.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of project dependencies to prevent future lockfile issues.
