**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: SSH, HTTPS, Networking, Troubleshooting, SSL, Port Forwarding  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to configure SSH tunnels for accessing web servers via HTTPS, troubleshoot common errors, and ensure secure communication.

**Key Activities:**
- Configured SSH tunnels to match web server ports and protocols, emphasizing the importance of avoiding port mismatches.
- Troubleshot HTTPS access issues via forwarded ports, focusing on server logs, firewall settings, and SSH client updates.
- Addressed SSL/TLS errors, specifically the SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG error, and provided troubleshooting steps.
- Provided instructions for accessing local web servers via HTTPS and resolving potential SSL configuration issues.
- Explained the use of SSH commands for local port forwarding and resolving forwarding issues.
- Discussed methods for identifying service ports using tools like nmap.
- Provided commands for SSH tunneling from local machines to remote servers, specifying port forwarding and connection details.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully configured SSH tunnels for HTTPS access, resolving several common errors and ensuring proper SSL/TLS configuration.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of SSH tunnel configurations in different network environments to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring of server logs to preemptively identify and resolve potential issues.
