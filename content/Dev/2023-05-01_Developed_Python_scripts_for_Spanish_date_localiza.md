## 📅 2023-05-01 — Session: Developed Python scripts for Spanish date localization

**🕒 05:00–06:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Localization, Date Formatting, Spanish, Datetime  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop [[Python]] scripts for generating and formatting date ranges with localization in Spanish, focusing on handling weekdays and month names.

**Key Activities:**
- Created [[Python]] functions to generate formatted text for time periods, considering different month scenarios.
- Implemented a function to generate datetimes for specific weekdays (Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays).
- Developed code to use Spanish month and weekday names in the `strftime` function, setting the locale accordingly.
- Addressed a `ValueError` in the `generate_datetimes()` function, ensuring correct date formatting and resolving issues with invalid end dates.
- Finalized a [[Python]] script to generate time periods with weekdays in Spanish, including abbreviations and handling date ranges across months.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created and tested [[Python]] scripts for date localization in Spanish, enhancing the ability to format dates and times in a culturally relevant manner.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the scripts in different environments to ensure robustness and accuracy.
