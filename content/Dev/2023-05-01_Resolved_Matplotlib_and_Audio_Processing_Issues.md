## üìÖ 2023-05-01 ‚Äî Session: Resolved Matplotlib and Audio Processing Issues

**üïí 20:10‚Äì20:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Matplotlib, Audio Processing, Speech Recognition, Ffmpeg  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to address technical issues related to [[Python]] libraries, specifically focusing on [[Matplotlib]] errors and audio processing for speech recognition.

### Key Activities
- **[[Matplotlib]] [[Troubleshooting]]**: Resolved errors related to the pyplot module by reinstalling the package and using the agg backend.
- **Speech Recognition Code**: Developed a [[Python]] program utilizing the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe audio files into text.
- **Audio Conversion**: Engaged in converting audio files to WAV format using the pydub library and FFmpeg.
- **FFmpeg Installation**: Installed FFmpeg to facilitate audio format conversion, ensuring the system's PATH variable was updated.
- **Google Speech Recognition [[API]]**: Implemented a [[Python]] script to utilize Google‚Äôs [[API]] for audio transcription and addressed `UnknownValueError` by improving audio quality.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[Matplotlib]] pyplot import errors.
- Completed a [[Python]] script for converting and transcribing audio files.
- Installed FFmpeg and updated system configurations for audio processing.
- Enhanced audio quality for better transcription results using Google‚Äôs [[API]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of audio format conversion techniques to optimize processing speed and accuracy.
- Continuous monitoring and troubleshooting of potential errors in speech recognition tasks.
