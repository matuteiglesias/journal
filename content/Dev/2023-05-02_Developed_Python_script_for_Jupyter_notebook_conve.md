## 📅 2023-05-02 — Session: Developed Python script for Jupyter notebook conversion

**🕒 18:00–19:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Jupyter, Code Conversion, Regex, File Handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a [[Python]] script capable of converting a [[Python]] file into a [[Jupyter]] notebook format by ensuring proper formatting and handling of cell indicators.

### Key Activities
- Introduced SQL basics including database creation and management.
- Modified [[Python]] code to ensure an empty line precedes each `# %%` cell indicator for better readability.
- Implemented a regex pattern to handle newline issues in [[Python]] scripts.
- Developed a [[Python]] script to convert a [[Python]] file into a [[Jupyter]] notebook, ensuring proper formatting and saving the results.
- Debugged and improved regex patterns for text processing and newline handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a [[Python]] script that modifies a given file, adds necessary formatting, and converts it into a [[Jupyter]] notebook.
- Ensured that the script handles both markdown and code cells appropriately.

### Pending Tasks
- Verify the script's functionality with various [[Python]] files to ensure robustness and handle edge cases.
