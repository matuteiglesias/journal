## 📅 2023-05-02 — Session: Implemented Data Filtering and Aggregation Techniques

**🕒 19:50–20:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Manipulation, Pandas, Audio Processing, Data Analysis, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on exploring and implementing various data manipulation techniques using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]], NumPy, and SciPy. The goal was to enhance skills in data filtering, aggregation, and audio signal processing.

### Key Activities
- **Data Manipulation with [[Pandas]]:** Techniques for filtering, classification, and merging datasets were explored with practical code examples.
- **Audio Signal Processing:** Exercises on filtering noise from audio signals using Fourier transforms and low-pass filters in [[Python]].
- **Data Filtering Exercises:** Implemented data filtering for automotive and sales datasets using [[Pandas]], focusing on specific conditions like price and sales dates.
- **Data Aggregation and Summary:** Practical exercises on aggregating and summarizing sales data using [[Pandas]], including calculating averages and identifying trends.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented data filtering techniques in various contexts, including automotive datasets and audio signals.
- Achieved a comprehensive understanding of data aggregation and summary methods using [[Pandas]] and NumPy.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced audio processing techniques and their applications in different domains.
- Investigation of more complex data aggregation scenarios and their impact on data analysis outcomes.
