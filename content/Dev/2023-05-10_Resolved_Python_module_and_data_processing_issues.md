## üìÖ 2023-05-10 ‚Äî Session: Resolved Python module and data processing issues

**üïí 00:00‚Äì23:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Pandas, Spacy, Networkx, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve issues with [[Python]] modules and enhance data processing techniques using [[Pandas]] and SpaCy libraries.

### Key Activities
- **Module [[Troubleshooting]]**: Addressed a missing module issue in the `instapy` package related to `clarifai.rest` by providing installation instructions.
- **Selenium Session [[Debugging]]**: Resolved issues with Firefox browser driver for Selenium sessions with InstaPy, including updates and alternative browser options.
- **[[Data Processing]] with [[Pandas]]**: Developed [[Python]] code snippets for data grouping, merging, and aggregation using [[Pandas]], focusing on election data.
- **Text Analysis with SpaCy**: Implemented text processing techniques to filter out small words and connectors, and created dummy columns for frequent words in datasets.
- **Graph [[Visualization]] with NetworkX**: Created and optimized NetworkX graphs from correlation matrices, focusing on strong edges and visualization clarity.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved module and browser driver issues, enabling smoother execution of InstaPy scripts.
- Enhanced data processing capabilities with efficient [[Pandas]] operations and SpaCy for text analysis.
- Improved graph visualization techniques for better interpretation of data correlations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of data processing scripts for larger datasets.
- Exploration of additional visualization techniques for complex data structures.
