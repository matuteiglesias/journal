## 📅 2023-05-18 — Session: Explored File Management and Disk Usage in Linux

**🕒 13:20–14:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Linux, Command Line, Disk Usage, Git, File Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to explore file management and disk usage analysis on Linux systems using command-line tools and [[Git]] version control.

**Key Activities:**
- Reflected on sorting search results in Ubuntu's Nautilus file explorer and identified workarounds using both the graphical interface and command line.
- Executed commands using the `du` command for disk usage analysis, including options for human-readable format and sorting.
- Provided command examples for displaying and sorting disk usage of files recursively using `find`, `du`, and `sort`.
- Generated a `.gitignore` file to exclude large files from version control, detailing command components for clarity.
- Explained the role of `.gitignore` in version control and the necessity of additional commands for managing already committed files.
- Reflected on [[Git]] add commands and their specific use cases for staging changes.

**Achievements:**
- Clarified methods for managing and analyzing disk usage on Linux.
- Enhanced understanding of [[Git]] commands and version control practices.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of advanced file management techniques in Linux.
- Investigate additional [[Git]] automation tools for improved workflow.
