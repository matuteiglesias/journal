## 📅 2023-05-18 — Session: Implemented Gitignore and Data Analysis Techniques

**🕒 02:20–03:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Git, Pandas, Data Visualization, Clustering, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance repository management by excluding unnecessary folders using `.gitignore` and to perform advanced data analysis and visualization using [[Python]] libraries.

### Key Activities
- Configured a `.gitignore` file to exclude the `datos` folder from the [[Git]] repository, including staging and committing the changes.
- Demonstrated data manipulation using pandas, including grouping and aggregating data by monthly frequency and creating a date table from grouped data.
- Formatted dates in a DataFrame to 'yyyy-mm' format for better readability.
- Created and customized a correlation matrix heatmap using Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]], with a focus on visual clarity and customization.
- Applied hierarchical clustering to time series data, visualizing it with a dendrogram using Seaborn.
- Utilized Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for comparing time series of different lengths, enhancing clustering analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully excluded a folder from the [[Git]] repository using `.gitignore`.
- Completed data aggregation and visualization tasks, including the creation of a correlation matrix heatmap and hierarchical clustering dendrogram.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced clustering techniques and optimization of data visualization parameters may be required for future sessions.
