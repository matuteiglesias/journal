## üìÖ 2023-05-18 ‚Äî Session: Resolved UnicodeEncodeError in Python Geopandas

**üïí 16:30‚Äì18:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Geopandas, Unicode, Error Handling, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve the UnicodeEncodeError encountered in [[Python]], specifically when using the GeoPandas library for geospatial data processing.

### Key Activities
- **Resolved UnicodeEncodeError**: Addressed the UnicodeEncodeError related to the character '√≥' by using 'latin1' encoding in the `gpd.read_file()` function.
- **Handled Encoding in Geopandas**: Provided a solution for manually decoding response content from a URL using 'latin1' encoding before reading it with `gpd.read_file()`.
- **Troubleshot DriverError**: Offered guidance on resolving the `DriverError: PK...` by verifying file paths, checking URL accessibility, and ensuring network stability.
- **ZIP File Handling**: Implemented a [[Python]] code snippet for downloading a ZIP file, extracting a [[JSON]] file, and reading it using GeoPandas.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved encoding issues in [[Python]] and GeoPandas, enabling smoother data processing workflows.
- Improved the handling of ZIP files for [[JSON]] extraction, enhancing data accessibility.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of encoding solutions in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Exploration of additional encoding methods for broader compatibility.
