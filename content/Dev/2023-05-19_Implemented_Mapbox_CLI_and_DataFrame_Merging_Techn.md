**🕒 21:20–23:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Mapbox, CLI, Pandas, Data Management, Web Development  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data management capabilities using Mapbox CLI for tileset operations and improve data manipulation techniques with [[Pandas]].

### Key Activities
- Utilized Mapbox CLI commands to manage tilesets related to income and poverty data, including uploading and publishing new tilesets.
- Demonstrated merging of [[Pandas]] DataFrames using multi-index and column-based techniques to resolve index mismatch issues.
- Explored executing shell commands within [[Jupyter]] Notebooks to streamline tileset management.
- Installed Mapbox CLI and addressed npm registry issues using alternative methods such as Yarn.
- Set up environment variables for Mapbox access token in [[Python]] to ensure seamless tileset operations.
- Developed a Mapbox map comparison feature using [[HTML]] and JavaScript, including a dropdown menu for style selection.

### Achievements
- Successfully managed Mapbox tilesets and resolved installation issues.
- Improved data manipulation skills with [[Pandas]], particularly in handling multi-index DataFrames.
- Enhanced web development skills by implementing a Mapbox map comparison feature.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore advanced Mapbox CLI features for more efficient data management.
- Investigate additional data manipulation techniques in [[Pandas]] to handle complex datasets more effectively.
