### Session Goal
The session aimed to streamline the process of simplifying GeoDataFrames and saving them as GeoJSON files, focusing on improving the precision and handling of geospatial data.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a loop to simplify GeoDataFrames with varying tolerances, saving each version as a GeoJSON file with dynamic filenames.
- Developed a method to round coordinates in GeoJSON files post-simplification, ensuring data precision.
- Resolved conversion issues from GeoSeries to GeoDataFrame, enabling further modifications and proper GeoJSON saving.
- Corrected a lambda function for GeoJSON conversion using the `shapely.geometry.mapping` function.
- Updated the simplification process to eliminate unnecessary conversions and ensure proper rounding of coordinates.
- Addressed and fixed errors related to geometry object attributes and column name issues in GeoDataFrames.

### Achievements
- Successfully streamlined the GeoDataFrame simplification process, resulting in efficient and precise GeoJSON outputs.
- Improved handling of MultiPolygon geometries and resolved attribute errors, enhancing data processing reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing with larger datasets to ensure scalability and performance.
- Explore additional optimization techniques for geospatial data processing.
