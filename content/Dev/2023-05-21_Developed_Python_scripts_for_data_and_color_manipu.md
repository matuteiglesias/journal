## üìÖ 2023-05-21 ‚Äî Session: Developed Python scripts for data and color manipulation

**üïí 17:20‚Äì21:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Pandas, JSON, Color Palette, Mapbox  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripting capabilities for data analysis, [[JSON]] manipulation, and color palette generation.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented [[Pandas]] functions for calculating vote percentages, excluding specific entries, and aggregating data.
- Developed [[Python]] scripts for extracting and modifying [[JSON]] objects, focusing on data visualization layers.
- Created functions for generating and updating color palettes using the colorsys and matplotlib libraries.
- Modified Mapbox style [[JSON]] files to update fill colors and manage style uploads via [[API]].

**Achievements:**
- Successfully calculated percentages and aggregated data using [[Pandas]].
- Enhanced [[JSON]] manipulation skills, particularly for data visualization.
- Developed robust color palette generation scripts, including reverse color order functionality.
- Implemented Mapbox style modifications, enabling dynamic style updates via [[Python]] scripts.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the Mapbox [[API]] integration to ensure seamless style updates.
- [[Optimization]] of color palette functions for broader application scenarios.
