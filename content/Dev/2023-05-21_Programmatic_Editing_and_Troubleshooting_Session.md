## üìÖ 2023-05-21 ‚Äî Session: Programmatic Editing and Troubleshooting Session

**üïí 04:50‚Äì06:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Mapbox, Linux, PHP, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to explore and implement techniques for programmatically manipulating [[JSON]] documents, particularly focusing on Mapbox style [[JSON]] files, and to troubleshoot disk space issues on a Linux filesystem.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a PHP class for Divi Builder to manage border styles.
- Reviewed Mapbox style [[JSON]] and documentation to understand its structure and components.
- Explored programmatic editing of Mapbox style [[JSON]] using the Mapbox Styles [[API]], including fetching, modifying, and uploading [[JSON]] documents.
- Discussed various techniques for [[JSON]] manipulation using programming languages like [[Python]], including using libraries and templating engines.
- Provided [[Python]] code snippets for handling [[JSON]] data, focusing on reading, inspecting, and manipulating [[JSON]].
- Addressed disk space issues on a Linux filesystem by using command line tools such as `df` and `du`, and provided insights into cleaning up disk space and analyzing file sizes.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully outlined a systematic approach for programmatically editing Mapbox style [[JSON]].
- Clarified techniques for [[JSON]] manipulation across different programming environments.
- Provided actionable steps for troubleshooting disk space issues on Linux.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of advanced [[JSON]] manipulation techniques and their applications in different domains.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of disk space usage on the filesystem.
