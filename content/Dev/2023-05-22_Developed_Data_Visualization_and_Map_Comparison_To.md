**üïí 09:25‚Äì11:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Mapbox, Javascript, Web Development  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Python]] and to develop interactive map comparison tools using Mapbox GL JS.

### Key Activities:
- Implemented [[Python]] code for creating histograms from grouped data using [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]].
- Developed methods to plot cumulative distribution functions and isolate specific ranges within these plots.
- Enhanced visualization by extracting and annotating extreme values in cumulative distribution curves.
- Modified color palette functions to include alpha channel adjustments for better visual customization.
- Created interactive [[HTML]] documents using Mapbox GL JS for side-by-side map comparisons.
- Implemented dropdown menus for dynamic style changes in maps, utilizing JavaScript for event handling and style updates.

### Achievements:
- Successfully created and visualized histograms and cumulative distribution functions in [[Python]].
- Developed a robust [[HTML]] and JavaScript solution for interactive map comparisons, allowing for dynamic user interaction.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and refinement of map style update functions to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.
