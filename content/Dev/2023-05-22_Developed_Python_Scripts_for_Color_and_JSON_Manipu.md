## 📅 2023-05-22 — Session: Developed Python Scripts for Color and JSON Manipulation

**🕒 02:00–02:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, JSON, Color Palette, Data Manipulation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop [[Python]] scripts for generating color palettes and manipulating [[JSON]] style files, leveraging libraries like `matplotlib` and integrating with the Mapbox [[API]].

### Key Activities:
- **Color Palette Generation**: Implemented and corrected a [[Python]] function to generate color palettes from base hex colors, converting them to RGB and back, and including endpoints.
- **[[JSON]] Style File Manipulation**: Developed scripts to load, extract, edit, and save [[JSON]] style objects. This included integrating with the Mapbox [[API]] to retrieve and save style [[JSON]] files.

### Achievements:
- Successfully created and visualized color palettes using `matplotlib`.
- Corrected errors in the color palette generation function, ensuring accurate input and output.
- Developed robust scripts for [[JSON]] manipulation, including extracting and editing style objects, and saving them as separate [[JSON]] files.
- Integrated with the Mapbox [[API]] to retrieve and save [[JSON]] styles.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of the [[JSON]] manipulation scripts to ensure compatibility with various [[JSON]] structures.
