## 📅 2023-05-22 — Session: Developed Python scripts for data manipulation and storage

**🕒 02:30–03:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Manipulation, File Handling, Pandas, Numpy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:** The goal of this session was to develop [[Python]] scripts for manipulating data and saving it in various formats, including [[JSON]], text, and [[CSV]] files.

**Key Activities:**
1. Implemented a [[Python]] script to save modified style data to a [[JSON]] file, utilizing a base name variable for filename formatting.
2. Developed a method to generate base names from series data with two-level indices, facilitating the creation of modified style file copies.
3. Utilized NumPy's `ravel` function to flatten nested arrays in a [[Pandas]] Series before generating base names.
4. Demonstrated the use of the `iterrows()` method to iterate over a [[Pandas]] series with multi-level indices, generating combined base names.
5. Converted a DataFrame into a multi-index series to generate base names by combining index values with unique elements from the series.
6. Created a [[Python]] script to generate base names from a DataFrame using specific tags and saved them to a text file.
7. Developed a [[Python]] script to save data to [[CSV]] files, including the length of a list and its associated styles.

**Achievements:** Successfully developed and tested multiple [[Python]] scripts for data manipulation and storage, enhancing the ability to handle complex data structures and export them in various formats.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Review and optimize the scripts for performance and scalability.
- Integrate these scripts into a larger data processing pipeline if applicable.
