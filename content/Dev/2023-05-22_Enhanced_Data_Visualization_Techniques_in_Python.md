## 📅 2023-05-22 — Session: Enhanced Data Visualization Techniques in Python

**🕒 21:30–22:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Matplotlib, Pandas, Function Modification  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques in [[Python]], focusing on customizing plots and addressing indexing issues.

### Key Activities
- Modified the `process_data` function to optionally handle date ranges, allowing the function to return the original dataframe when no date range is specified.
- Customized histogram legend labels using [[Matplotlib]] for better data representation.
- Implemented histogram plotting by month using pandas and [[Matplotlib]], leveraging `pd.Grouper` for datetime grouping.
- Created a heatmap-like plot to visualize event occurrences on specific days, similar to GitHub's contribution graph.
- Developed a weekly grid representation of marked days, utilizing [[Matplotlib]] for visualization.
- Transposed a grid for vertical display using NumPy, enhancing the visualization of resistance events.
- Set x-axis tick labels to days of the week to improve plot readability.
- Corrected week index calculation and grid indexing to ensure proper alignment and display of marked days.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented optional date range handling in data processing functions.
- Enhanced data visualization plots with customized legends and improved readability.
- Resolved indexing issues in grid plots, ensuring accurate representation of time-based data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore advanced data visualization techniques to enhance user interaction and insights.
