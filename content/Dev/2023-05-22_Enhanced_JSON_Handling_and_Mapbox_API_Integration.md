**üïí 05:30‚Äì07:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, JSON, Mapbox Api, Code Debugging, Style Management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to fix syntax errors in [[Python]] code for [[JSON]] handling, enhance [[JSON]] manipulation functions, and integrate these functions with the Mapbox [[API]] for style management.

### Key Activities
- **Syntax Error Fixes**: Corrected issues with f-strings in [[Python]] code to ensure proper [[JSON]] file handling.
- **Function Development**: Created and modified functions for [[JSON]] manipulation, including replacing text field basenames and adjusting text opacity zoom in style objects.
- **Mapbox [[API]] [[Integration]]**: Developed code to store and update Mapbox style information, including handling [[API]] tokens and troubleshooting common errors like HTTP 400 and [[JSON]] validation issues.
- **Style Management**: Implemented functions to create and update styles using the Mapbox Styles [[API]], ensuring proper [[JSON]] structure and [[API]] request handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed syntax errors and enhanced [[JSON]] handling functions.
- Integrated [[JSON]] manipulation with Mapbox [[API]] for automated style management.
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of [[API]] token scopes and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize [[JSON]] handling functions for broader use cases.
- Explore additional Mapbox [[API]] features for enhanced style customization.
