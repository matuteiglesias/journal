## 📅 2023-05-22 — Session: Enhanced Python Function for Fill Opacity Update

**🕒 04:20–04:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Function, Data Manipulation, Error Handling, Code Update  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to refine a [[Python]] function that updates the 'fill-opacity' values in a style object, ensuring compatibility with varying zoom levels and handling potential length mismatches gracefully.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] function to replace 'fill-opacity' values in a style object, incorporating error handling for mismatched lengths.
- Modified the function to issue warnings instead of errors when length mismatches occur between existing and new zoom values.
- Ensured the function maintains the integrity of the first three elements in the 'fill-opacity' list while allowing updates to subsequent elements.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a robust [[Python]] function that updates 'fill-opacity' values, with built-in checks for length mismatches and warnings to alert users without interrupting execution.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing is required to validate the function across different datasets and edge cases to ensure reliability and robustness in various scenarios.
