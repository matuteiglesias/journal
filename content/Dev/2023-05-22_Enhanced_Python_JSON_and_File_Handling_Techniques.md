### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] coding techniques focusing on [[JSON]] manipulation and file handling.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a [[Python]] script to save the length of a `base_names` list to text files.
- Demonstrated reading from text files using [[Python]]'s `open()` and `read()` methods.
- Provided a method to split a string of base names into a list for easier manipulation.
- Optimized [[Python]] code for editing [[JSON]] objects, removing unnecessary iterations.
- Updated [[JSON]] editing script to ensure each base name has a single edited version saved.
- Showcased how to display [[JSON]] with indentation using the `json.dump()` function for readability.
- Explained the use of `json.dumps()` for printing indented [[JSON]] objects.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized [[JSON]] handling and file operations in [[Python]].
- Improved readability and maintainability of [[JSON]] outputs.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the optimized [[JSON]] editing scripts to ensure robustness.
- Explore additional [[Python]] libraries for advanced [[JSON]] manipulation.
