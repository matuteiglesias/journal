**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Zoom Values, Style Object, Function Development, Debugging  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine [[Python]] functions to manipulate zoom values within a style [[JSON]] object, particularly focusing on the 'fill-opacity' property.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] function for recursively editing zoom values in a style [[JSON]] object using a mapping dictionary.
- Created functions to replace zoom values in style objects, ensuring consistency between existing and new values.
- Updated the `replace_zoom_values` function to handle single and multiple zoom values effectively.
- Introduced and clarified the `replace_fill_opacity_zoom` function for specific handling of the 'fill-opacity' property.
- Provided debugging techniques to print keys of the 'paint' object for verification.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and refined functions to manipulate zoom values in style objects.
- Addressed limitations in previous implementations by introducing updated functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the `replace_fill_opacity_zoom` function across diverse style objects to ensure robustness.
