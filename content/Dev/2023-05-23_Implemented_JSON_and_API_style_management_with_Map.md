### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement and manage style information using [[JSON]] files and the Mapbox [[API]], alongside resolving common web development issues.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script to save and update style information in [[JSON]] files, using the Mapbox [[API]] for style management.
- Implemented functions for creating and updating Mapbox styles, including error handling for [[API]] responses.
- Demonstrated loading [[JSON]] data into [[HTML]] using JavaScript and the Fetch [[API]].
- Resolved CORS errors by setting up a local web server with [[Python]] to serve [[HTML]] and [[JSON]] files.
- Filtered command-line history for SSH commands using `grep` and explored troubleshooting steps for SSH and network connectivity issues.

### Achievements
- Successfully managed style information using [[JSON]] and Mapbox [[API]].
- Established a local web server to overcome CORS issues.
- Enhanced command-line utility skills for SSH and network troubleshooting.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the error handling mechanisms in the Mapbox style management script.
- Explore additional methods to automate the local web server setup for ease of use.
