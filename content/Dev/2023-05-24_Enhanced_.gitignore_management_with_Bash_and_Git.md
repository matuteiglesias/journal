## 📅 2023-05-24 — Session: Enhanced .gitignore management with Bash and Git

**🕒 19:35–20:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Gitignore, Bash, Automation, File Management, Encoding  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the management of the `.gitignore` file by automating the inclusion of large files and ensuring proper file encoding and path formats.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a Bash command to clear and update the `.gitignore` file with files larger than 99 MB.
- Utilized the `tee` command for appending output to `.gitignore` while adding descriptive comments.
- Implemented solutions to resolve issues with [[Git]] not ignoring previously tracked files using `git rm --cached`.
- Checked and set the encoding of the `.gitignore` file to UTF-8 using `vim` and verified it using the `file` command.
- Generated a `.gitignore` file with paths formatted relative to the repository root using `find` and `sed`.

**Achievements:**
- Automated the process of managing large files in `.gitignore`, ensuring they are ignored by [[Git]].
- Ensured the `.gitignore` file is correctly encoded and paths are properly formatted.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the `.gitignore` automation in different repository environments to confirm robustness.
