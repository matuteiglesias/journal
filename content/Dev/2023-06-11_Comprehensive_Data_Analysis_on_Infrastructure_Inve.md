## üìÖ 2023-06-11 ‚Äî Session: Comprehensive Data Analysis on Infrastructure Investment

**üïí 20:30‚Äì21:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Analysis, Regression, Infrastructure Investment, Developer Responsibilities, Matching Algorithm  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to conduct a comprehensive data analysis to explore the relationship between infrastructure investment and various socio-economic factors, including violence levels and social stability.

### Key Activities
- **Clarification of Developer Responsibilities:** Finalized the developer's role in code availability and user empowerment, ensuring future independence in code application.
- **Algorithm Quality Control:** Implemented diagnostics for a matching algorithm to ensure data quality and covariate balance.
- **[[Data Processing]] for Conflict and Service Delivery Project:** Planned the matching process for data processing, focusing on algorithm design and outcome evaluation.
- **Datasets Merge:** Outlined the merging of multiple datasets (DHS, Afrobarometer, ACLED, Population) for enhanced analysis related to investment projects and social stability.
- **Regression Analysis:** Conducted regression analysis to estimate the effect of infrastructure investment using OLS, focusing on treatment effect computation.
- **Comprehensive [[Data Analysis]]:** Performed a series of analyses on merged datasets to explore the relationship between infrastructure investment and violence levels, including regression analysis and robustness checks.

### Achievements
- Completed the developer's role clarification and code availability.
- Successfully implemented diagnostics for algorithm quality control.
- Planned and outlined data processing for conflict and service delivery projects.
- Merged datasets for enhanced analysis of investment projects and social stability.
- Conducted regression analysis to estimate the effects of infrastructure investment.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the matching algorithm and diagnostics.
- Additional robustness checks on regression analysis results.
