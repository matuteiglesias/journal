## 📅 2023-06-11 — Session: Developed and Documented Geospatial Data Processing Scripts

**🕒 06:50–08:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Geospatial Analysis, Data Processing, DHS, Raster Data  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop, organize, and document [[Python]] scripts for processing geospatial data, particularly focusing on raster data aggregation, spatial joins, and DHS survey point assignments.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script for aggregating raster data into polygons using libraries like `pandas`, `geopandas`, and `rasterstats`.
- Created a README file for the raster data aggregation script, detailing usage instructions and input/output specifications.
- Organized [[Python]] header cells for better code readability and structure, focusing on import statements and dependency management.
- Developed and documented a spatial join script to analyze violent events within geographic boundaries, including installation and execution instructions.
- Created scripts for assigning DHS survey points to administrative areas, facilitating data consolidation and analysis.
- Improved [[Python]] code structure for plotting DHS points in Africa, enhancing clarity and reducing redundancy.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and documented multiple geospatial data processing scripts.
- Enhanced code readability and organization through structured [[Python]] headers and improved comments.
- Provided comprehensive documentation for users, including README files and execution instructions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the developed scripts to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- [[Integration]] of these scripts into larger data processing workflows for comprehensive geospatial analysis.
