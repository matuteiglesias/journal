## 📅 2023-06-11 — Session: Processed Afrobarometer and Chinese Projects Data

**🕒 09:00–09:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Processing, Afrobarometer, Chinese Projects, Spatial Analysis, Data Cleaning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to review and enhance data processing scripts for Afrobarometer and Chinese projects, focusing on spatial analysis, data cleaning, and integration techniques.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed the Afrobarometer data processing script, which involves data loading, intersection with administrative areas, and output generation such as intersection files and maps.
- Summarized challenges and techniques in spatial data handling and data cleaning for Afrobarometer data, highlighting its implications for public opinion dynamics.
- Analyzed challenges in processing Chinese projects data, including data integration, standardization, and geolocation, and discussed techniques to overcome these challenges.
- Detailed a script that intersects investment points with administrative areas using GeoJSON files, producing [[CSV]] outputs for further analysis.
- Analyzed a script for preprocessing cleaned data from the '05 - Investments' directory, focusing on data aggregation and cleaning.
- Reviewed the `aggregate_csv_GID` function, which aggregates [[CSV]] data by geographical identifiers (GID) and time periods.

### Achievements
- Successfully reviewed and understood the processes and challenges involved in processing Afrobarometer and Chinese projects data.
- Identified key techniques and outputs for spatial analysis and data cleaning.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine data integration techniques for Chinese projects.
- Explore more efficient methods for spatial data handling in Afrobarometer projects.
