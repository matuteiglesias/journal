## 📅 2023-06-12 — Session: Developed Matching Algorithm and Troubleshooting Techniques

**🕒 06:20–07:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Matching Algorithm, Troubleshooting, Ubuntu, Treatment Evaluation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding and execution plan for matching algorithms in treatment evaluation, and to troubleshoot cursor and touchpad issues on Ubuntu systems.

### Key Activities
- **Matching Algorithm Overview**: Reviewed the steps involved in the matching algorithm, focusing on data preparation, application, and analysis.
- **Linear Assignment Execution**: Implemented a linear assignment algorithm using the Hungarian method for optimal treatment and control unit matching.
- **Cost Matrix Construction**: Detailed the process of constructing a cost matrix, including data handling and imputation techniques.
- **Cursor Flickering [[Troubleshooting]]**: Explored potential causes and solutions for cursor flickering issues on hardware and Ubuntu systems.
- **Touchpad Sensitivity Adjustment**: Provided steps to resolve touchpad sensitivity issues on Ubuntu, including driver checks and settings adjustments.

### Achievements
- Established a structured approach for implementing matching algorithms in treatment evaluation.
- Developed troubleshooting guides for cursor and touchpad issues on Ubuntu.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the matching algorithm implementation.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of Ubuntu system settings for cursor and touchpad performance.
