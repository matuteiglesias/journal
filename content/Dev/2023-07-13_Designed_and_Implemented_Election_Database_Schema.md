## 📅 2023-07-13 — Session: Designed and Implemented Election Database Schema

**🕒 00:20–01:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Database, Election, Schema, SQL, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and implement a comprehensive database schema for managing election-related data, including defining tables, relationships, and data manipulation processes.

### Key Activities
- **Database Schema Design**: Outlined a detailed database schema for election management using markdown, including tables, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- **SQL Table Creation**: Provided SQL DDL examples for creating election-related tables, ensuring proper key definitions.
- **DBML Schema Representation**: Developed a DBML schema for the election database, detailing the structure and relationships between entities.
- **Data Manipulation with [[Python]]**: Implemented [[Python]] code using [[Pandas]] for loading, filtering, and concatenating datasets related to election data.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a structured database schema for election management, covering all necessary tables and relationships.
- Developed and tested SQL and DBML scripts for database implementation.
- Implemented effective data manipulation techniques using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the database schema with real election data.
- [[Optimization]] of [[Python]] scripts for better performance with larger datasets.
