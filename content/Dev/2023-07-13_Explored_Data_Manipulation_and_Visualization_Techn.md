## 📅 2023-07-13 — Session: Explored Data Manipulation and Visualization Techniques

**🕒 23:05–23:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Data Visualization, Clustering, Data Manipulation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to explore various data manipulation and visualization techniques using [[Python]]'s pandas and seaborn libraries.

### Key Activities
- **DataFrame Manipulation**: Techniques for converting MultiIndex to a regular DataFrame using `reset_index` and `to_frame` methods were discussed. The session also covered reshaping data using `pivot_table` and `unstack` methods.
- **[[Data [[Visualization]]]]**: Created correlation matrix heatmaps using seaborn and matplotlib, including transposing matrices and generating visualizations.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Explored hierarchical clustering for correlation matrix analysis using scipy, including visualizing results with dendrograms and performing PCA.
- **Data Concatenation**: Demonstrated concatenating DataFrame columns using pandas `apply` function.

### Achievements
- Successfully converted MultiIndex DataFrames and reshaped data using pandas.
- Created comprehensive visualizations of correlation matrices.
- Applied hierarchical clustering techniques and visualized results effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of PCA results to derive actionable insights.
- Investigate alternative clustering methods for deeper analysis.
