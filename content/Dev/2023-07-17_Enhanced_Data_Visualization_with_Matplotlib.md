## 📅 2023-07-17 — Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Matplotlib

**🕒 18:35–21:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Matplotlib, Data Visualization, Pandas, Email Template  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn in [[Python]], focusing on creating clear and informative plots.

### Key Activities
- Developed an email template for GitLab access issues.
- Corrected syntax for `str.contains()` in [[Pandas]] for better data manipulation.
- Created various plots using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn, including thin gray lines, color representations, and vertical colorbars.
- Revised and adjusted [[Python]] code for plotting slope values, aligning annotations, and customizing plot aesthetics.
- Calculated monthly rates of change from logarithmic slopes, providing insights into financial data.
- Implemented subplots for time series data visualization.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and customized multiple [[Matplotlib]] plots, improving data visualization clarity and accuracy.
- Clarified complex data manipulation techniques in [[Pandas]].
- Provided actionable insights into financial data through logarithmic calculations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the email template for GitLab access issues based on feedback.
- Explore additional customization options in [[Matplotlib]] for more complex datasets.
