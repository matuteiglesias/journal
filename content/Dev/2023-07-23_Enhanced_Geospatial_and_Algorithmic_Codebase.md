**üïí 02:30‚Äì19:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Geospatial, Python, Algorithm, Modularization, Randomization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the geospatial analysis capabilities and improve algorithmic procedures in [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a geospatial analysis notebook for villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing on elevation and terrain ruggedness using [[Python]] and GeoJSON.
- Planned and outlined a strategy for modularizing [[Python]] code, emphasizing best practices such as utility modules, OOP, and version control.
- Updated the geodesic buffer function in Pyproj to avoid FutureWarnings by replacing deprecated functions.
- Modified the RANDOMLY_PERMUTE procedure to ensure it applies to a nonempty subarray, including an updated proof of Lemma 5.4.
- Implemented the PERMUTE_WITHOUT_IDENTITY algorithm to generate permutations excluding the identity permutation.
- Analyzed the PERMUTE-WITH-ALL algorithm, identifying issues with uniform random permutations due to fixed points.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a comprehensive geospatial analysis notebook.
- Established a clear plan for [[Python]] code modularization.
- Updated geodesic buffer functions to prevent future deprecation issues.
- Enhanced the RANDOMLY_PERMUTE procedure with a robust proof.
- Developed and tested the PERMUTE_WITHOUT_IDENTITY algorithm.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated geodesic buffer function.
- Implementation of the outlined modularization strategy across existing codebases.
