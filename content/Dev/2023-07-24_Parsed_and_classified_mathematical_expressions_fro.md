### Session Goal
The session aimed to parse LaTeX documents and classify mathematical expressions contained within them.

### Key Activities
- **Parsing LaTeX Documents**: Initiated with understanding the structure of LaTeX files, focusing on the preamble and the use of packages.
- **Extracting Mathematical Expressions**: Developed a systematic approach to extract mathematical expressions from LaTeX files.
- **Classifying Expressions**: Implemented classification of 90 mathematical expressions into subfields such as Calculus, Algebra/Statistics, Probability/Statistics, Statistics, and Set Theory.

### Achievements
- Successfully parsed LaTeX documents and extracted mathematical expressions.
- Established rules for classifying expressions into various mathematical subfields.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of classification rules to improve accuracy in categorizing expressions.
- Exploration of automated methods for parsing and classification to enhance efficiency.
