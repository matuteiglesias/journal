## 📅 2023-07-25 — Session: Implemented dynamic Python package management

**🕒 20:30–21:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Package Management, File Handling, Jupyter Notebooks, Geospatial Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance [[Python]] scripts by implementing dynamic package management and improving file handling techniques.

### Key Activities:
- Developed code snippets for automatic installation of missing [[Python]] modules using try/except blocks to handle `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Implemented dynamic installation for 'pyunpack' and 'patool' packages to ensure necessary dependencies are available.
- Enhanced file management by checking for extraction directory existence and correcting path formations.
- Addressed directory name discrepancies using `os.path.isdir()` for accurate directory checks.
- Interpreted [[Jupyter]] notebooks for data download and geospatial analysis using `geopandas`.
- Provided guides for processing census geometries and managing geospatial data workflows.

### Achievements:
- Successfully automated [[Python]] package management and improved file handling processes.
- Clarified the structure and functionality of [[Jupyter]] notebook cells for geospatial data analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of dynamic package installation scripts.
- Exploration of additional error handling mechanisms in [[Python]] scripts.
