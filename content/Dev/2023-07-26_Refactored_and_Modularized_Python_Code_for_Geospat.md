## üìÖ 2023-07-26 ‚Äî Session: Refactored and Modularized Python Code for Geospatial Data

**üïí 04:00‚Äì07:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Geospatial, Data Processing, Code Refactoring, Geopandas  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the processing and analysis of geospatial data through improved [[Python]] code structure and functionality.

### Key Activities
- **Geospatial [[Data Processing]]**: Loaded, processed, and saved geographical data in GeoJSON format, focusing on clarity through code comments.
- **Data Manipulation with [[Pandas]]**: Loaded [[CSV]] data into pandas DataFrame, converted it back to a dictionary, and utilized `select_dtypes()` for data type selection.
- **Code [[Refactoring]]**: Refactored [[Python]] code to improve organization, readability, and modularization, including the creation of reusable functions for data processing.
- **[[Data Processing]] Enhancements**: Revised scripts for merging geographic and aggregated data using [[Pandas]] and GeoPandas, ensuring consistency in variable naming and comments.
- **Project Overviews and Naming**: Reviewed the GeoCenso-Visualizer project and proposed [[SEO]]-focused repository names for better visibility.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored and modularized the [[Python]] code, improving its clarity and reusability.
- Enhanced data processing scripts for geospatial analysis, ensuring better integration and visualization of geographic census data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the GeoCenso-Visualizer project documentation and contribution guidelines.
- Finalization of [[SEO]]-optimized repository names for enhanced project discoverability.
