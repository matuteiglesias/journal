### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and analyze dynamic programming solutions for two classic problems: the rod cutting problem and the box stacking problem.

### Key Activities
- **Rod Cutting Problem:**
  - Explored both recursive and bottom-up dynamic programming approaches to solve the rod cutting problem.
  - Detailed the recursive formulation for minimizing cutting costs and compared it with a bottom-up strategy, analyzing time and space complexities.
  - Translated C++ code snippets into [[Python]] to illustrate algorithm implementation differences.
- **Box Stacking Problem:**
  - Investigated backtracking and dynamic programming solutions for the box stacking problem.
  - Defined recursive functions to maximize the number of stackable boxes based on weight constraints, with implementations in LaTeX.
  - Discussed inefficiencies of backtracking and improvements using dynamic programming.

### Achievements
- Successfully formulated and compared dynamic programming strategies for both problems, highlighting the advantages of bottom-up approaches.
- Completed code translations and complexity analysis, providing a clear understanding of algorithmic efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the box stacking problem using advanced dynamic programming techniques.
- Explore additional test cases and scenarios for both problems to ensure robustness of solutions.
