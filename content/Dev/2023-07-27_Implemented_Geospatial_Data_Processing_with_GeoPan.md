**üïí 19:30‚Äì20:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Geopandas, Geospatial, Python, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement geospatial data processing using GeoPandas, focusing on loading, manipulating, and analyzing geospatial data.

### Key Activities
- **Loading [[JSON]] Data**: A guide was provided for downloading [[JSON]] data from a URL and loading it into a GeoDataFrame using GeoPandas.
- **Downloading and Extracting Shapefiles**: [[Python]] code examples were shared for downloading ZIP files containing shapefiles and loading them into a GeoDataFrame.
- **Handling SSL Errors**: Instructions were given on bypassing SSL certificate verification when downloading files with the requests library, along with a security best practices warning.
- **Specifying Extraction Directories**: Solutions for extracting ZIP files to specified directories were discussed.
- **Spatial Join and Overlay**: Techniques for performing spatial joins and curated overlays on GeoDataFrames were implemented, including sorting columns by unique value counts.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented methods for loading and processing geospatial data using GeoPandas.
- Developed functions for spatial joins and curated overlays, enhancing data analysis capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of security best practices when handling SSL certificates in production environments.
- [[Optimization]] of data manipulation techniques for larger datasets.
