## 📅 2023-07-30 — Session: Debugged JavaScript and Python file operations

**🕒 19:20–21:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Javascript, Python, Debugging, File Handling, Web Development  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:** The session aimed to enhance file handling in [[Python]] and debug JavaScript code for dynamic UI updates and error resolution.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented [[Python]] scripts to conditionally create files and generate empty [[JSON]] files.
- Developed JavaScript solutions for dynamically updating select menu options and extracting menu options from [[JSON]] keys.
- Conducted extensive debugging of JavaScript code, addressing type errors, console logging issues, and event handler problems.
- Utilized [[Python]]'s `http.server` module to run a local HTTP server for serving [[HTML]] files.
- Troubleshot 404 errors and caching issues related to the `style_info.json` file.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created [[Python]] scripts for file management and initiated a local HTTP server.
- Enhanced JavaScript code to dynamically update UI elements and resolved multiple debugging challenges.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further investigation into persistent caching issues and 404 errors for `style_info.json` may be required.
- Additional testing of JavaScript event handlers to ensure robust functionality.
