**🕒 20:40–20:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Web Scraping, Data Extraction, CSV, Beautifulsoup, Radio Schedules  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop [[Python]] scripts to automate the process of web scraping radio schedule data and manage it effectively.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a [[Python]] script using BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape schedule data from specified URLs.
- Developed a code snippet to extract names of people associated with programs from [[HTML]] descriptions.
- Created a script to extract radio station names from URLs.
- Generated URLs from a list of radio names using list comprehension.
- Saved radio schedules into a [[CSV]] file using the built-in `csv` module, capturing details such as station name, start time, program name, and description.
- Aggregated schedules from multiple stations into a single master list for easier identification and analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a set of [[Python]] scripts that automate the extraction and management of radio schedule data.
- Enhanced data processing capabilities by aggregating information from multiple sources into a cohesive format.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the scripts in a production environment to ensure robustness and accuracy.
