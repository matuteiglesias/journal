**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance text processing capabilities by refining name extraction methods and manipulating data using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Developed [[Python]] functions to extract proper names from unstructured text using heuristics and regular expressions.
- Improved the name extraction code to handle capitalized word chains and filter out false positives.
- Created a new DataFrame from existing data by iterating through rows and matching names in descriptions.
- Generated a markdown report in Argentine Spanish and formatted dates using Spanish locale settings.
- Converted markdown content to [[HTML]] and enhanced the output with Bootstrap for improved appearance.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and refined name extraction techniques using [[Python]].
- Developed methods for data manipulation with [[Pandas]], including creating new DataFrames based on name matches.
- Generated formatted reports in markdown and [[HTML]], applying localization for Spanish.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of name extraction functions with diverse datasets to ensure robustness.
- Exploration of additional styling options for [[HTML]] reports using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
