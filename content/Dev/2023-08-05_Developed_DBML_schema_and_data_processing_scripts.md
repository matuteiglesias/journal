## 📅 2023-08-05 — Session: Developed DBML schema and data processing scripts

**🕒 21:00–22:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: DBML, Python, Data Transformation, Data Modeling, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive DBML schema for data transformation processes and enhance data processing capabilities using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Created a DBML schema to outline the structure for input and transformed data tables from [[CSV]] files.
- Defined 1:1 relationships between columns in tables using DBML, visualized with dbdiagram.io.
- Updated the DBML representation to include new tables (RFC1, RFC2, RFC3) and their relationships.
- Provided [[Python]] code snippets for loading [[CSV]] columns, updating DataFrame sources from GitHub, and standardizing region names.
- Demonstrated concatenation of multiple [[CSV]] files and merging them using an 'ID' column.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a detailed DBML schema for enhanced data modeling.
- Implemented [[Python]] scripts to automate data loading, cleaning, and transformation tasks.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of DBML schemas to incorporate additional data tables and relationships.
- [[Optimization]] of [[Python]] scripts for performance improvements.
