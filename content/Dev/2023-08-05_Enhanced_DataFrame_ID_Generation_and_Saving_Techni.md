**üïí 09:20‚Äì10:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Dataframe, Id Generation, Data Saving, Code Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to enhance data manipulation techniques in [[Python]], focusing on generating unique IDs for DataFrame rows and optimizing data saving processes.

### Key Activities:
- **Generating Unique IDs:** Explored methods to create unique IDs for DataFrame rows by combining random numbers with the last two digits of the year, using a set seed for reproducibility.
- **Seeding with File Size:** Implemented a technique to use file size as a seed for random number generation, ensuring consistent ID generation across runs with the same file.
- **Inserting Columns:** Demonstrated how to insert a new column in a DataFrame at a specified location using the `insert` function.
- **Saving DataFrames:** Detailed the process of saving a DataFrame to a [[CSV]] file with the index included as a column, using pandas.
- **Efficiency Improvement:** Reflected on code optimization by saving only predictions instead of both input data and predictions, enhancing memory efficiency.
- **Code Correction:** Provided a corrected [[Python]] code for defining a list of dictionaries in the `predict_save` function, ensuring proper syntax.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented unique ID generation techniques and optimized data saving strategies.
- Improved code efficiency and correctness in data handling tasks.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of additional methods for ID generation and data saving optimizations could be beneficial.
