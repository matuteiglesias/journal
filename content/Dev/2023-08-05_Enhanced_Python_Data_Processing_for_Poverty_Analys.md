**üïí 22:35‚Äì23:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Poverty Analysis, Automation, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve and automate the data processing workflow for poverty analysis using [[Python]], focusing on code refactoring, modularity, and error handling.

### Key Activities
- **Code [[Refactoring]]**: Reviewed and refactored data transformation functions to enhance readability, maintainability, and efficiency, particularly using the [[Pandas]] library.
- **Function Development**: Developed functions for calculating basic basket metrics and poverty metrics, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- **Data Merging**: Created functions to load and merge [[CSV]] files into a single DataFrame based on a common ID, facilitating comprehensive data analysis.
- **[[Automation]]**: Implemented automation for quarterly data processing, including looping through quarters and applying functions to process and save data.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Incorporated error handling mechanisms to manage file loading exceptions, ensuring robustness in data processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored and modularized key functions for poverty data analysis.
- Automated the data processing workflow for the years 2015 and 2016, enhancing efficiency.
- Improved error handling in data loading processes, ensuring continuity in case of missing files.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the automated data processing pipeline to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Exploration of additional data sources to enrich the poverty analysis dataset.
