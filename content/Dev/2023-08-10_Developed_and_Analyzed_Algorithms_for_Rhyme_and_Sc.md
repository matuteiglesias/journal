### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and implement algorithms for minimizing 'cringe' in poetry and optimizing scheduling for conferences and attractions.

### Key Activities
- Reformulated a problem involving rhyme in poetry, focusing on minimizing resource usage to achieve rhyming words through recursive and dynamic programming techniques.
- Developed a dynamic programming solution using a top-down memoization approach to optimize word division into verses.
- Compared recursive solutions for rhyme minimization, highlighting differences in problem definition and dynamic programming usage.
- Defined a recursive function to calculate minimum 'cringe' and implemented it using dynamic programming.
- Formally defined problems for string generation and interval graphs, proposing recursive algorithms and analyzing their complexity.
- Developed a recursive function for string generation with constraints, utilizing a top-down approach with memoization.
- Explored greedy algorithms for maximizing presentation impact at scientific conferences, including [[Python]] implementations for prioritizing presentations by value and scheduling.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and analyzed algorithms for minimizing 'cringe' in poetry and optimizing conference scheduling.
- Developed [[Python]] algorithms for maximizing presentation impact and scheduling conferences and attractions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development and testing of additional functions for conference and attraction scheduling.
- [[Integration]] of greedy and dynamic programming concepts in educational exercises.
