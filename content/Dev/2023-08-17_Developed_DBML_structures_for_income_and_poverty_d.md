## 📅 2023-08-17 — Session: Developed DBML structures for income and poverty data

**🕒 12:40–14:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: DBML, Database, Data Modeling, Poverty, Income  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and refine Database Markup Language (DBML) structures for databases concerning circuits, radio circuits, and poverty data.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a hierarchical database structure analysis, focusing on circuits and radio circuits, and proposed a DBML structure.
- Outlined tables and relationships for poverty data, providing a DBML structure for implementation.
- Reformatted DBML representation for tables related to personas and poverty, including primary and foreign key notations.
- Documented the structure and key variables of income and poverty tables in markdown format.
- Revised DBML notation for various database tables to ensure alignment with specified formats.
- Explained the use of inline notation for defining database tables, including keys and constraints.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and refined DBML structures for both circuits and poverty-related data tables.
- Ensured clarity and alignment in database design through markdown documentation and revised notations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further validation and testing of the DBML structures in a live database environment to ensure practical applicability and performance.
