## üìÖ 2023-08-17 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Python Script with Logging and Debugging

**üïí 04:05‚Äì05:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Logging, Troubleshooting, Code Generalization, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The session aimed to enhance a [[Python]] script with improved logging, troubleshoot file save issues, and implement best practices for code generalization.

**Key Activities**:
- Enhanced a [[Python]] script to include detailed logging with timestamps and progress messages, improving traceability and performance monitoring.
- Diagnosed and troubleshot file save issues by checking file paths, disk space, filesystem errors, and script logic.
- Addressed disk space and file integrity issues on an external drive using Linux commands.
- Implemented best practices for code generalization, such as using relative paths, user-defined paths, and configuration files.
- Developed a script to log progress and elapsed time for data processing tasks.
- Verified DataFrame merge operations by adding checks for row count consistency and logging results.
- Enhanced logging functions with a `verbose` argument to control the verbosity of log messages.

**Achievements**: Successfully enhanced the [[Python]] script with comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities. Implemented best practices for code generalization and verified data processing steps.

**Pending Tasks**: Further testing of the enhanced script in different environments to ensure robustness and adaptability.
