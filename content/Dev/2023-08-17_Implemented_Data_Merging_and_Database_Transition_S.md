## 📅 2023-08-17 — Session: Implemented Data Merging and Database Transition Strategies

**🕒 21:10–22:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Merging, Python, Pandas, Database, API  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to implement effective data merging strategies using [[Python]]'s pandas library and transition data processing from [[CSV]] files to a database-driven approach.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed structured workflows for merging multiple datasets in [[Python]] using pandas, providing specific code snippets for implementation.
- Adapted existing data loading procedures to accommodate new [[CSV]] file paths and merge multiple DataFrames.
- Transitioned data processing scripts from reading [[CSV]] files to querying a relational database, including establishing a database connection and understanding the database structure.
- Generated a tree view of Google Drive using the Google Drive [[API]], demonstrating the integration of external APIs with [[Python]] scripting.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully outlined and implemented data merging strategies, enhancing data manipulation capabilities.
- Transitioned data processing workflows from [[CSV]] to database, improving data management efficiency.
- Developed a [[Python]] script for generating a tree view of Google Drive, showcasing [[API]] usage.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refine the database querying process to optimize data retrieval and processing.
- Continue testing and validation of the new data processing workflows to ensure accuracy and performance.
