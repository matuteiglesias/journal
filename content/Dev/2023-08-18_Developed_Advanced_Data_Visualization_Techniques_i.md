## 📅 2023-08-18 — Session: Developed Advanced Data Visualization Techniques in Python

**🕒 20:15–20:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Visualization, Matplotlib, Python, Scatter Plot, Box Plot  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization capabilities using [[Python]]'s [[Matplotlib]] library by integrating scatter and box plots in various configurations.

### Key Activities
- Detailed exploration of plotting scatter and box plots on the same figure using [[Matplotlib]]'s subplot feature.
- Implemented loops to generate scatter and weighted box plots for combinations of DataFrame columns.
- Developed code for creating combined scatter and box plots for unique data combinations from the 'main_listas' DataFrame.
- Generated separate figures with subplots for each parameter combination in a DataFrame.
- Stacked scatter and box plots vertically within a single figure using `gridspec_kw` for size adjustments.
- Superimposed box plots on scatter plots using the same X-axis, specifically for income data.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented multiple data visualization techniques, enhancing the ability to analyze and present data insights effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of visualization code for performance and clarity.
- Explore additional customization options for plot aesthetics and interactivity.
