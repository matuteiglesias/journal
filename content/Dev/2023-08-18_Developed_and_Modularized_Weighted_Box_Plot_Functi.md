**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop and modularize functions for creating weighted box plots and scatter plots in [[Python]], enhancing their reusability and flexibility.

**Key Activities:**
- Created a guide for generating weighted box plots using custom functions to compute weighted quartiles.
- Developed a method for computing weighted quartiles by bins, utilizing [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].
- Implemented a custom boxplot visualization with [[Matplotlib]], detailing visual elements.
- Developed `plot_scatter` and `plot_weighted_box` functions for generating scatter and weighted box plots.
- Refactored the `plot_scatter` function to improve modularity by allowing direct parameter input.
- Created a color dictionary for political groups to enhance plot aesthetics.
- Modularized the `plot_weighted_box` function by adding arguments for data input and binning, updating the code for weighted quantiles and box plots.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created and modularized [[Python]] functions for weighted box plots and scatter plots.
- Enhanced the reusability and flexibility of plotting functions through refactoring and modularization.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the modularized functions in diverse data scenarios.
- [[Integration]] of the color dictionary into existing plotting functions for consistent aesthetics.
