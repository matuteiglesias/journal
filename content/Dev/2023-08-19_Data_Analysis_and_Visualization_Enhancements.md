## 📅 2023-08-19 — Session: Data Analysis and Visualization Enhancements

**🕒 21:45–22:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Analysis, Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Data Visualization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data analysis and visualization techniques using [[Python]], focusing on identifying representative regions, generating district plots, and addressing visualization issues.

### Key Activities
- **Representative Region Identification**: Utilized [[Pandas]] to group dataset entries by 'distrito_id', 'seccion_id', and 'seccion_nombre', counting rows to identify the most representative region.
- **District Plot Generation**: Developed [[Python]] scripts using [[Matplotlib]] to create and save plots for each unique district, ensuring proper labeling.
- **Region Plotting**: Implemented a loop in [[Python]] to filter data by unique regions in a DataFrame and generate corresponding plots, saving them with specific filenames.
- **Super Title Adjustment**: Addressed and resolved a [[Matplotlib]] issue where the super title was being cut off by adjusting the layout after setting the title.
- **DataFrame Filtering**: Filtered a DataFrame for the 'Pampeana' region and 'La Libertad Avanza' agrupación, extracting necessary columns.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified the representative region from the dataset.
- Generated and saved district and region-specific plots with accurate labels and filenames.
- Resolved the [[Matplotlib]] super title cutoff issue, ensuring better presentation of plots.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of data visualization techniques for other regions and agrupacións.
- [[Optimization]] of data filtering processes for enhanced performance.
