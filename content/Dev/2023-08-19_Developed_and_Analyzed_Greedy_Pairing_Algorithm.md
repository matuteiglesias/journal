## 📅 2023-08-19 — Session: Developed and Analyzed Greedy Pairing Algorithm

**🕒 18:55–19:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Greedy Algorithm, Python, Backtracking, Optimization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to implement and analyze a greedy algorithm for pairing dancers based on their skills and weights, and to compare its optimality with a backtracking approach.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented a greedy algorithm in [[Python]] to pair dancers, focusing on skills and weights.
- Analyzed the algorithm's optimality and compared it with backtracking solutions.
- Discussed the benefits and limitations of greedy versus backtracking strategies in algorithm design.
- Streamlined the code for clarity and efficiency, ensuring optimal local pairings.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented a functional greedy pairing algorithm.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of greedy and backtracking approaches, with initial results showing optimal pairings using the greedy method.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further verification of the greedy algorithm's optimality through detailed comparison with backtracking results.
