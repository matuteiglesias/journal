### Session Goal:
The aim of this session was to explore and execute various methods for accessing, downloading, and processing Landsat satellite imagery data using [[Google Cloud]] services.

### Key Activities:
- Implemented a solution to suppress warnings in multi-indexed DataFrame operations using [[Python]]'s warnings module.
- Provided detailed instructions for accessing satellite datasets via [[Google Cloud]] Storage (GCS) and BigQuery, including navigation and querying processes.
- Guided on using [[Google Cloud]] Storage through the [[Google Cloud]] Console, covering tasks like bucket creation and data management.
- Outlined methods to access the public Landsat data bucket on [[Google Cloud]] Storage using various tools and libraries.
- Installed and authenticated the `google-cloud-storage` package in [[Python]] for accessing [[Google Cloud]] services.
- Set up Application Default Credentials for [[Google Cloud]] to facilitate authentication in cloud environments.
- Detailed steps for downloading and processing Landsat data for Argentina in 2020, including filtering and decompressing data using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].

### Achievements:
- Successfully accessed and processed Landsat data using [[Google Cloud]] services.
- Implemented efficient data handling and processing techniques using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of advanced data processing techniques for Landsat data.
- [[Optimization]] of data access and processing workflows for scalability and performance.
