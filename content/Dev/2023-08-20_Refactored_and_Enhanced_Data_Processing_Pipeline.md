## üìÖ 2023-08-20 ‚Äî Session: Refactored and Enhanced Data Processing Pipeline

**üïí 04:00‚Äì05:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Code Refactoring, Geopandas, Data Visualization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The session aimed to refactor and enhance the [[Python]] code for data processing tasks, focusing on code clarity, efficiency, and resolving specific errors.

**Key Activities**:
- Refactored [[Python]] scripts to improve code clarity and efficiency, focusing on data loading, preprocessing, and merging operations.
- Addressed a `MergeError` in DataFrames with multi-level columns by flattening columns and correctly performing merge operations.
- Implemented methods for dropping MultiIndex levels in [[Pandas]] DataFrames and merging them with specific keys.
- Resolved errors related to the absence of an active geometry column in GeoDataFrames for plotting with GeoPandas.
- Troubleshot NaN values in geometry columns affecting plotting, ensuring data cleaning processes were in place.
- Developed techniques for displaying tables and plots for districts and sections using IPython and [[Matplotlib]].
- Guided the overlay of data on maps using [[Matplotlib]], including transparency adjustments.
- Created a function to compute zoom levels based on bounding box widths for map image processing.

**Achievements**:
- Enhanced code readability and maintainability through refactoring.
- Successfully resolved data merging and plotting errors, improving the data visualization process.
- Developed reusable functions for zoom level calculation and data overlay on maps.

**Pending Tasks**:
- Further testing and validation of the refactored code in different data processing scenarios.
- Exploration of additional optimization techniques for large datasets.
