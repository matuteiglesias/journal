**üïí 06:40‚Äì07:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Pandas, Dataframe, Visualization, Python, Styling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the visualization of data within [[Pandas]] DataFrames by applying various styling techniques, including horizontal bars and scientific notation.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented a code snippet to style [[Pandas]] DataFrame cells with gray bars normalized against a common maximum value.
- Resolved an import error by ensuring `matplotlib.pyplot` was correctly imported for plotting purposes.
- Developed a function to style DataFrames using horizontal bars, proportional to the maximum absolute value.
- Applied scientific notation styling to DataFrame numbers using the `Styler` object from [[Pandas]].
- Created a custom function for engineering notation formatting within DataFrames, enhancing visual representation.
- Extracted specific data from a multi-indexed DataFrame using the `loc` indexer, focusing on 'Union Por La Patria'.
- Designed a function to compare cargo tags in voting data, demonstrating its application through example scenarios.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully styled DataFrames with horizontal bars and scientific/engineering notation, improving data visualization.
- Resolved import issues, ensuring smooth execution of plotting functions.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the custom styling functions with different datasets to ensure robustness.
