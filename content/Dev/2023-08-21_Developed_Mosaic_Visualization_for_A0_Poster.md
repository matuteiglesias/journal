### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a method for creating a high-resolution mosaic visualization of an A0 poster using Google Maps images.

### Key Activities
- Explored the use of Google Maps [[API]] to obtain satellite images for high-resolution mapping.
- Designed the `planificar_mosaico` function to divide an A0 poster into A4 sections and calculate coordinates for image retrieval.
- Utilized `matplotlib` to create subplots for visualizing the poster mosaic, initially using placeholder images.
- Integrated the `get_image_with_timeout` function to fetch actual images, addressing threading and import issues.
- Discussed error handling and limitations due to lack of internet access for real image retrieval.
- Adjusted visualization functions to consider DPI for print quality.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and implemented functions for mosaic planning and visualization.
- Addressed code issues such as missing imports and threading requirements.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the `get_maps_image` function in an internet-enabled environment to retrieve real images from Google Maps [[API]].
- Finalize the mosaic visualization with actual images and verify print quality.
