## üìÖ 2023-08-22 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Python Data Processing and Visualization

**üïí 19:30‚Äì21:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Visualization, Elections, Modularization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address issues in [[Python]] data processing and enhance code modularity and visualization for electoral data analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Handling Empty Arrays**: Implemented error handling for quantile computation in [[Python]] to manage empty arrays.
- **Code Modularization**: Improved and modularized data processing code by encapsulating repeated patterns into functions and using loops for combinations of `agruplista` and `difftag`. This included saving data in GeoJSON format.
- **Electoral [[Data Analysis]]**: Developed a [[Python]] procedure to analyze electoral groupings by region and section, calculating vote percentages for 2019 and 2023 elections.
- **Markdown Presentation Generation**: Created [[Python]] scripts to generate Markdown presentations with tables of votes and percentages, organized by region and section.
- **[[Visualization]] of Votes and Percentages**: Generated structured tables comparing election results from 2019 and 2023, filtering data to highlight relevant information.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented error handling for quantile computations.
- Enhanced code modularity, improving maintainability and efficiency.
- Developed comprehensive data analysis and visualization tools for electoral data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of data processing functions for scalability.
- [[Integration]] of additional data sources for a broader analysis scope.
