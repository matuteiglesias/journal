## 📅 2023-08-25 — Session: Optimized DataFrame Grouping with Dask

**🕒 19:15–19:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Dask, Dataframe, Optimization, Python, Memory Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address and resolve a memory overflow issue encountered during a multi-level index groupby operation in a DataFrame, and to optimize the data processing workflow using Dask.

### Key Activities
- Identified a memory overflow problem during DataFrame grouping and explored optimization strategies.
- Corrected an oversight in library imports necessary for the operations.
- Proceeded with computation plans using existing imports, focusing on counting unique values in the 'PROP' column.
- Resolved issues related to session statefulness and data loading, particularly concerning the `PERSONA` dataset.
- Implemented a step-by-step optimization approach for grouping operations using Dask, including code snippets for efficient computation.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined a plan to optimize DataFrame operations with Dask, addressing memory management and computation efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Re-import necessary libraries in future sessions to avoid similar oversights.
- Consider re-running computations with a `ProgressBar` once session state issues are resolved.
