## 📅 2023-08-25 — Session: Resolved Age Binning and DataFrame Conversion Issues

**🕒 18:40–19:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, Dask, Data_Processing, Error_Handling, Age_Binning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve errors and inefficiencies in the data processing pipeline, specifically focusing on age binning and DataFrame handling using [[Pandas]] and Dask.

### Key Activities
- **Error Fixing**: Addressed an error with age binning in [[Pandas]] by modifying the code to correctly compute global age bins using `map_partitions`.
- **Data Structure Diagnosis**: Identified and corrected the conversion of `PERSONA` from a DataFrame to a Series, ensuring it retains the correct structure throughout operations.
- **Quantile Binning**: Investigated discrepancies in quantile binning due to tie values, recommending the use of numpy's percentile function for more accurate bin sizes.
- **DataFrame Conversion**: Managed the transition of `PERSONA` from a Dask DataFrame to a [[Pandas]] DataFrame post-binning, confirming the expected behavior and verifying the accuracy of age binning through value counts.
- **Environment Management**: Handled the environment reset by re-importing modules and reloading datasets to ensure smooth code execution.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the age binning error and ensured the correct handling of DataFrame conversions between Dask and [[Pandas]].
- Developed a systematic approach to diagnose and correct discrepancies in data binning.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated pipeline in different environments to ensure robustness and efficiency.
- Exploration of additional methods for optimizing data processing workflows involving large datasets.
