## üìÖ 2023-08-25 ‚Äî Session: Statistical Modeling and Data Analysis Session

**üïí 20:50‚Äì21:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Statistical Modeling, Data Analysis, Python, Likelihood Estimation, Logistic Regression  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore statistical modeling techniques and data analysis methods, focusing on likelihood estimation, data manipulation, and regression analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Likelihood Estimation**: Implemented a [[Python]] example for estimating parameters of a TOM distribution using maximum likelihood estimation with scipy.
- **Data Manipulation**: Merged two [[Pandas]] DataFrames, `demographics` and `voting_outcomes`, to create a combined dataset.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Modeled voting outcomes using likelihood functions based on demographic data, involving data selection and transformation.
- **Parameter Inference**: Outlined steps for parameter estimation, including convergence assessment, confidence interval calculation, and model fit evaluation.
- **Logistic Regression**: Analyzed voting behavior using logistic regression, focusing on feature preparation, model fitting, and prediction.
- **Ecological Inference**: Examined King's ecological inference method for estimating individual voting behaviors from aggregate data using bivariate distributions.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented maximum likelihood estimation for TOM distribution parameters.
- Combined demographic and voting outcome data for comprehensive analysis.
- Developed a framework for modeling voting outcomes and analyzing voting behavior with logistic regression.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of ecological inference methods and their application in real-world datasets.
- Refinement of logistic regression models for improved prediction accuracy.
