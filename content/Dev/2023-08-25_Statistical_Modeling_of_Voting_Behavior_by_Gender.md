**üïí 21:25‚Äì21:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Voting, Statistics, Beta-Binomial, Ecological Inference, Data Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to estimate voting behavior by gender using statistical models, specifically the beta-binomial distribution, and to address code execution issues related to this analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Estimating Voting Behavior**: Utilized a beta-binomial distribution to estimate voting behavior of men and women for a political party, detailing the likelihood function and interpretation of estimated proportions across precincts.
- **Statistical Approach**: Addressed code execution issues and outlined a statistical approach using a binomial distribution to estimate voting proportions by gender.
- **Error Correction**: Identified and planned to correct an oversight in library imports necessary for calculations.
- **Modeling Vote Percentages**: Modeled vote percentages using a beta-binomial distribution, providing a step-by-step explanation and pseudo-code for ecological inference based on King's method.
- **Ecological Inference Implementation**: Implemented King's Ecological Inference using a beta-binomial likelihood function, including defining the likelihood function, objective function, optimization, and result interpretation.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive statistical model for estimating voting behavior by gender.
- Identified and planned correction for code execution issues related to library imports.

### Pending Tasks
- Import required libraries and rerun the calculations to ensure accuracy and completeness of the model.
- Gather more varied data to achieve nuanced results in voting behavior analysis.
