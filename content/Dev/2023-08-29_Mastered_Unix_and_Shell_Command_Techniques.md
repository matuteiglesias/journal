**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to explore and execute various command-line techniques in Unix-like systems, focusing on directory management, file extraction, and integrity checks.

**Key Activities:**
- Explored a command for listing directories by disk usage recursively, providing insights into each component of the command.
- Used the `grep` command with regular expressions to extract substrings from input strings, demonstrating practical examples.
- Demonstrated extracting filenames without extensions using shell parameter expansion and alternative command-line tools.
- Provided instructions for extracting `.zip` files using the `unzip` command, including installation guidance for the utility.
- Diagnosed and resolved ZIP file corruption issues, offering a comprehensive workflow for troubleshooting and recovery.
- Verified file integrity using MD5 checksums and provided alternative extraction methods when the `file` command is unavailable.
- Outlined recovery steps for corrupted ZIP files using the `7z` command, detailing the corruption nature and extraction results.

**Achievements:**
- Gained proficiency in Unix and shell command techniques, enhancing command-line efficiency and troubleshooting skills.
- Developed a robust understanding of file management and integrity verification processes.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of advanced file recovery techniques and command-line tools for enhanced data management.
