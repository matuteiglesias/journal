## üìÖ 2023-09-06 ‚Äî Session: Algorithm Optimization with Rest Days

**üïí 18:10‚Äì19:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Algorithm, Optimization, Dynamic Programming, Conferences  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the calculation of maximum experience from attending conferences and attractions, incorporating mandatory rest days after a set number of consecutive conferences.

### Key Activities
- Defined the recursive function `g(n, r)` in LaTeX to calculate maximum experience based on remaining days and attended conferences.
- Discussed the use of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for experience maximization in AlgorithmLand.
- Explained the `maxExperienceFromConferences` function, detailing its logic and rest day management.
- Adapted pseudocode and [[Python]] code to handle rest days after consecutive conferences.
- Implemented and modified the function in [[Python]] to ensure no activities are scheduled on rest days.

### Achievements
- Successfully incorporated rest days into the experience calculation algorithm.
- Enhanced the function's logic to optimize experience while adhering to constraints.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the modified algorithm to ensure robustness across various scenarios.
