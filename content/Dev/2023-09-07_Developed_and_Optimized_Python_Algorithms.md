## üìÖ 2023-09-07 ‚Äî Session: Developed and Optimized Python Algorithms

**üïí 23:20‚Äì23:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, algorithms, optimization, error correction, greedy algorithm, dynamic programming  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement and optimize various [[Python]] algorithms for specific problems, including minimum discontentment calculation, suspicious balances, and segmentation for chorip√°n stands.

### Key Activities
- Implemented the `min_descontento` function to optimize the order of correcting exams based on discontentment calculations.
- Corrected errors in the [[Python]] function for calculating minimum discontentment, focusing on variable usage.
- Developed the `saldos_sospechosos` function to determine the nature of numbers in relation to a final balance, acknowledging multiple valid solutions.
- Explored iterative and greedy approaches to the suspicious balances problem, comparing them with dynamic programming and backtracking methods.
- Implemented a segmentation [[strategy]] for chorip√°n stands, using [[Python]] to divide stands into segments and place supply points efficiently.
- Discussed a greedy algorithm approach for the chorip√°n problem, examining its efficiency and limitations.

### Achievements
The session successfully implemented and refined multiple algorithms, enhancing efficiency and addressing specific problem constraints.

### Pending Tasks
Further exploration of dynamic programming and backtracking methods for the suspicious balances and chorip√°n problems could provide more comprehensive solutions.
