## üìÖ 2023-09-11 ‚Äî Session: Development and Optimization of Graph Timing Experiments

**üïí 17:30‚Äì18:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Graph Theory, Timing Experiment, Python, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop and optimize functions for generating and analyzing graph structures, specifically focusing on timing experiments for different graph representations.

### Key Activities
- **Matrix Generation**: Developed functions to generate random adjacency matrices and graph representations, including adjacency matrix, edge set, and neighborhood set.
- **Class Implementations**: Implemented and modified [[Python]] classes `GraphWithEdgeSet` and `GraphWithNeighborhoodSet` to handle graph data structures efficiently.
- **Experiment Planning**: Created a detailed plan for conducting timing experiments on random networks, focusing on the execution time of graph operations.
- **Function Encapsulation**: Encapsulated the timing experiment logic into a `timing_experiment()` function, allowing flexible testing of graph methods.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Identified and addressed several errors in graph initialization and function argument passing, improving robustness.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and tested graph classes and functions, allowing for comprehensive timing experiments.
- Developed a flexible framework for analyzing execution time across different graph operations and representations.
- Identified and resolved critical errors in graph manipulation and function design.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize the `timing_experiment()` function to handle larger datasets efficiently.
- Continue debugging and refining error handling in graph operations, particularly in edge removal and adjacency checks.
