**üïí 21:30‚Äì23:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Graph Theory, Dataframe, Seaborn, Performance Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to implement and optimize graph initialization methods in [[Python]], along with analyzing and visualizing data using DataFrames and Seaborn.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented various graph initialization methods focusing on `initialize_from_edges` to enhance performance.
- Set default behaviors for vertex insertion and edge operations in graph classes, ensuring robust handling of cases with unspecified parameters.
- Conducted timing experiments on different methods, aggregating results in a DataFrame.
- Utilized pandas to group data and identify optimal representation methods based on performance metrics.
- Restructured code for analyzing winning methods and corrected execution errors.
- Visualized execution times using Seaborn's boxplot and lineplot, correcting code for proper visualization.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented default parameter handling for graph operations.
- Enhanced data analysis through optimized DataFrame operations and visualization techniques.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refine the graph initialization methods for additional performance gains.
- Explore additional visualization techniques to better represent execution time data.
