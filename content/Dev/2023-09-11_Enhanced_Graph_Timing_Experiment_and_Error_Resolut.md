## 📅 2023-09-11 — Session: Enhanced Graph Timing Experiment and Error Resolution

**🕒 19:30–20:53**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Graph Theory, Error Handling, Data Visualization, Programming  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the graph timing experiment by refining graph representations and resolving various [[Python]] errors related to graph methods.

### Key Activities
- Developed comparative graph plotting for `EdgeSet` and `NeighSet` using [[Matplotlib]].
- Modified DataFrame to include sparsity and edges for better graph representation analysis.
- Implemented a graph data structure using an adjacency matrix.
- Updated a [[Python]] function to measure execution times across different graph representations.
- Corrected errors in graph methods, including TypeErrors and ValueErrors.
- Simplified method arguments in graph classes to improve flexibility.
- Resolved IndexError in graph initialization and variable overwriting in loops.
- Reorganized function arguments to prevent conflicts in the `timing_experiment` function.

### Achievements
- Successfully plotted comparative graphs and updated timing experiment functions.
- Resolved multiple errors, enhancing the robustness of graph methods.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated graph methods and timing experiments to ensure all edge cases are handled.
- Explore additional optimizations for graph initialization and method execution.
