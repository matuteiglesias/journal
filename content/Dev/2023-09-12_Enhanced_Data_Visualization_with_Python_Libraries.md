## üìÖ 2023-09-12 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Python Libraries

**üïí 18:00‚Äì18:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: data visualization, Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, execution time  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary objective of this session was to enhance [[data visualization]] techniques using [[Python]] libraries, focusing on execution time visualization across different methods and data structures.

**Key Activities:**
- Adapted plots to visualize median execution times using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn, ensuring consistent styling.
- Developed [[Python]] code to handle sparse and dense datasets, facilitating method comparison.
- Evaluated and adjusted plot sizes and y-axis settings to improve clarity and comparability.
- Addressed code execution issues by preprocessing data and ensuring all necessary libraries were imported.
- Requested [[CSV]] file uploads for further [[data processing]] and plotting.
- Implemented logic to determine when to use shared or independent y-axes based on [[data analysis]].
- Debugged y-axis behavior in [[Matplotlib]], focusing on customization and synchronization issues.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully updated [[Python]] code to visualize performance metrics, adjusting y-axis scales based on dataset characteristics.
- Improved plotting techniques by integrating conditions for y-axis customization.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Finalize the integration of file uploads for complete [[data processing]] and visualization.
- Further refine y-axis customization logic to enhance clarity across all plot types.
