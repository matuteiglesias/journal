**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize a store placement algorithm for minimizing distance and to customize Markdown styling in Visual Studio Code using CSS.

### Key Activities
- **Algorithm [[Optimization]]**: Analyzed code to minimize accumulated distance when placing stores at specific positions, exploring mathematical equivalences and memoization techniques.
- **Function Naming**: Suggested improvements for function names to enhance code readability.
- **VS Code Customization**: Customized Markdown cell styles in Visual Studio Code by integrating Primer CSS, extracting CSS styles from various sources, and troubleshooting SCSS compilation issues.
- **Administrative Privileges**: Provided guidance on running Visual Studio Code with administrative privileges across different operating systems.

### Achievements
- Clarified the functions involved in the store placement algorithm and their mathematical equivalence.
- Improved function name readability for better code understanding.
- Successfully integrated Primer CSS into Visual Studio Code, enhancing the development environment's appearance.
- Resolved SCSS compilation and import issues related to Primer CSS.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore alternative solutions for any remaining SCSS import issues.
- Continue refining the store placement algorithm for optimal performance.
