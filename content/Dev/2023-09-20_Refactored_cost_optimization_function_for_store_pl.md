### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the function `calcular_distancia_acumulada` to accurately calculate the cost for determining the best store locations.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed the existing function `calcular_distancia_acumulada`, identifying errors related to cost calculation using virtual suppliers instead of real stores.
- Modified the function to compute distances between each post and its nearest supplier, integrating this logic into the main function `costo_minimo_desde_`.
- Corrected the `costo_minimo_desde_` function to ensure a valid list of stores is passed, fixing an error where `verbose` was used incorrectly.
- Addressed a recursive function error by adding a condition to return 0 if the list of stores is empty.
- Proposed corrections to ensure the accumulated cost is calculated correctly from the start to the current store, excluding posts with existing stores.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the function to improve the calculation of accumulated costs for store placement.
- Implemented [[error handling]] to prevent issues with empty lists in recursive functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] is required to achieve an optimal minimum cost for store placement.
