## 📅 2023-09-22 — Session: Enhanced Mapbox Styles and Color Management

**🕒 14:45–15:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Mapbox, Python, Color Management, Data Visualization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session focused on enhancing Mapbox styles by deleting outdated styles and improving color management for data visualizations.

### Key Activities:
- Implemented a [[Python]] script to delete old styles from the Mapbox Styles [[API]] using a [[CSV]] file to identify outdated styles.
- Developed wrapper functions `change_color_scale` and `change_cmap` to adjust color scales and maps in [[JSON]] style structures, utilizing NumPy for linear spacing.
- Extracted colors from [[Matplotlib]] color maps to facilitate color selection for visualizations, including a correction for accessing the `rgb2hex` function.
- Addressed a bug in color calculation within colormap functions by normalizing indices.
- Planned correction for variable redefinition to improve function testing.

### Achievements:
- Successfully integrated [[API]] deletion functionality for Mapbox styles.
- Enhanced color management through [[Python]] functions, improving [[data visualization]] capabilities.

### Pending Tasks:
- Redefine `cmap_name` and `n_stops` variables and re-run the function to ensure accurate testing.
