## üìÖ 2023-09-22 ‚Äî Session: Refactored and Debugged JSON Color Scaling Functions

**üïí 16:40‚Äì17:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Python, Debugging, Color Scaling, Programming  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to analyze and refactor the `fill-color` property in a [[JSON]] style object, focusing on [[debugging]] and improving the color scaling functions.

**Key Activities:**
- Analyzed the structure of the `fill-color` property and the interpolate function within a [[JSON]] object.
- Identified and corrected logic issues in the `change_color_scale` function related to color scaling.
- Addressed a code execution reset by recreating and testing functions.
- Corrected oversights in color value updates and function redefinition errors.
- Discussed mutable object handling in [[Python]], providing solutions for proper modification.
- Troubleshot color value update issues by adding diagnostic print statements.
- Fixed loop logic errors in [[JSON]] replacement operations, ensuring proper handling of hex color values.
- Updated scale values in [[JSON]] objects by targeting specific indices.
- Proposed creating a new interpolate list with updated values for accuracy in data handling.
- Reflected on object references and deep copy practices in [[JavaScript]] and [[Python]].
- Implemented `copy.deepcopy()` in [[Python]] to prevent in-place modifications.
- Unified color editing functions by refactoring [[Python]] scripts and removing redundant functions.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully refactored and debugged [[JSON]] color scaling functions.
- Improved understanding and handling of mutable objects in [[Python]] and [[JavaScript]].

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of the refactored functions to ensure robustness.
- Review and optimize the performance of updated [[JSON]] handling methods.
