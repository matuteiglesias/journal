## 📅 2023-09-23 — Session: Enhanced DataFrame and Visualization Techniques in Python

**🕒 19:00–19:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data manipulation and visualization techniques using [[Python]] libraries, specifically focusing on DataFrame operations and bar plot customizations.

### Key Activities
- Inserted values into a DataFrame, removed NaN entries, and recomputed derived metrics using [[Pandas]].
- Adjusted bar widths and positions in [[Matplotlib]] for better visual comparison.
- Customized bar plots in Seaborn to render specific bars as hollow for enhanced visual distinction.
- Modified the monthly payment structure in code to handle varying payment amounts and adjusted for inflation in debt payment simulations.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented DataFrame updates and visualized the results using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn.
- Enhanced the visual appeal and clarity of data presentations by customizing bar plots.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of code for handling larger datasets efficiently.
- Exploration of additional customization options in Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]] for more complex visualizations.
