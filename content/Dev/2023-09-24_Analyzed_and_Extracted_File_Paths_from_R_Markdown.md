## 📅 2023-09-24 — Session: Analyzed and Extracted File Paths from R Markdown

**🕒 00:45–01:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Rmarkdown, File Analysis, Csv Extraction, File Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to read and analyze the contents of an R Markdown (.Rmd) file to identify references to output files, particularly those with [[CSV]] extensions, and to manage these paths for future directory editing.

### Key Activities
- The assistant outlined a process to read the contents of a .Rmd file and search for references to output files, typically indicated by file paths.
- Encountered and handled an error during file reading, which involved retrying the reading process to ensure successful extraction of file references.
- Successfully read the R Markdown file, identified metadata in the YAML header, and prepared to search for output file references within the document's content.
- Identified 32 `.csv` files referenced in the .Rmd content and planned to extract their full paths to facilitate directory editing without errors.

### Achievements
- Completed the analysis of the R Markdown file and successfully extracted references to output files, specifically `.csv` files, which are crucial for data management and future directory structuring.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and adjust the extracted file paths according to the new directory structure to ensure smooth file management and access.
