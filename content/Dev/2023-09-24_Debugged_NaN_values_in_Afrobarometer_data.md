## 📅 2023-09-24 — Session: Debugged NaN values in Afrobarometer data

**🕒 00:15–00:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data_Processing, Python, R, Afrobarometer, Nan, Datetime  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to identify and resolve NaN values in the datetime column of Afrobarometer datasets and ensure proper data processing using both R and [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] NaN Values**: A systematic approach was outlined to identify and resolve NaN values in the datetime column of Afrobarometer datasets. This involved loading data and creating a comprehensive covariate data frame.
- **[[Python]] Implementation**: A [[Python]] script using the pandas library was provided to read and process multiple [[CSV]] files, mirroring an R implementation. This included data frame manipulation and year extraction from datetime columns.
- **Handling Mixed Date-Time Formats**: Instructions were given on resolving issues from mixed date-time formats in a pandas DataFrame using the `infer_datetime_format` argument in the `pd.to_datetime` function.
- **Fixing Date Parsing Error**: A solution was provided for a persistent error in date parsing by suggesting the use of 'format="mixed"' in the pandas `to_datetime` function.
- **Email Draft**: A draft email was created to provide an update on the Afrobarometer dataset, detailing the examination process and results regarding null values.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and resolved NaN values in the Afrobarometer datasets.
- Implemented a [[Python]] script for processing [[CSV]] files, enhancing data handling capabilities.
- Addressed mixed date-time format issues and date parsing errors in pandas.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[Python]] script on additional datasets to ensure robustness.
- Finalize and send the email draft regarding the Afrobarometer dataset analysis.
