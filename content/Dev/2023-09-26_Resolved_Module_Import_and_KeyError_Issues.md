**üïí 01:50‚Äì02:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Error Correction, Data Processing, Documentation, Collaboration  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve programming errors related to missing module imports and format string logic, as well as manage dataset documentation and collaboration communication.

**Key Activities:**
1. **Correction of Missing Module Import:** The `os` module was identified as missing, crucial for path-related operations, and was corrected.
2. **[[Troubleshooting]] KeyError in Format Strings:** [[Debugging]] was performed to identify and correct a KeyError in format strings, ensuring proper mapping of placeholders.
3. **Dataset Path Generation and Organization:** Paths were generated and organized in a DataFrame, ready for [[CSV]] export.
4. **Generating [[Documentation]] Files:** [[Documentation]] files were created for datasets with 10 columns or fewer and saved in the `dataset_md` directory.
5. **Proactive Email Response:** Drafted and sent a response to a professor regarding dataset collaboration, focusing on data merging and clarifying dataset requirements.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully corrected module import and KeyError issues.
- Generated and organized dataset paths.
- Created and saved dataset documentation.
- Communicated effectively for dataset collaboration.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Verify the exported [[CSV]] files for accuracy.
- Follow up on dataset collaboration specifics with the professor.
