## 📅 2023-09-28 — Session: Collaborative Dataset Merging and XML Parsing for Talks

**🕒 14:45–15:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Xml Parsing, Data Merging, Graph Creation, Python, Data Conversion  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to collaborate on merging datasets and creating graphs for upcoming talks at UC Berkeley and Yale, focusing on development projects. Additionally, it involved processing XML data for project analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Collaboration with Ruolin**: Worked on merging datasets and creating graphs for development projects.
- **Dataset Overview**: Reviewed Polity IV and Our World in Data datasets for insights into political regimes and global development.
- **Email Summary**: Summarized Ruolin's emails regarding data cleaning and categorization needs.
- **[[Data Analysis]]**: Loaded and analyzed datasets related to project funding using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].
- **XML Processing**: Developed scripts to load, parse, and extract data from XML files using [[Python]] libraries like lxml and ElementTree.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Addressed XML parsing errors and refined data extraction strategies.
- **Data Conversion**: Discussed mapping XML to [[CSV]] and converting XML to nested [[JSON]].

### Achievements
- Successfully merged datasets and created preliminary graphs for talks.
- Developed and tested [[Python]] scripts for XML data processing and error handling.
- Established a strategy for converting XML data into [[CSV]] and [[JSON]] formats.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize and validate the graphs for the upcoming talks.
- Complete the data conversion processes and verify data integrity.
- Respond to Ruolin with updates on data cleaning and categorization efforts.
