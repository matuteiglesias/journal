## 📅 2023-09-28 — Session: Implemented Data Processing for Country Name Merging

**🕒 18:10–19:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Processing, CSV, Pandas, Data Cleaning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement a robust data processing workflow to handle country name discrepancies across multiple datasets, using [[Python]] and its libraries.

### Key Activities
- **Opening .dta Files**: Explored various methods to open Stata data files (.dta) using [[Python]] with pandas, R with the haven package, and other statistical tools.
- **Merging Datasets**: Developed and executed a [[Python]] script using pandas to merge multiple datasets, focusing on identifying and resolving discrepancies in country names.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implemented a [[Python]] code snippet to fix duplicated country names in a DataFrame by splitting and retaining only the first part of the 'countryname' column.
- **Dataframe Logic**: Created a script to merge dataframes on country names, sum money columns, and display results with merge indicators.
- **[[CSV]] Generation**: Generated a [[CSV]] file containing unique country names from datasets to facilitate manual matching.

### Achievements
- Successfully merged datasets and identified discrepancies in country names.
- Cleaned data by correcting duplicated country names.
- Created a [[CSV]] for manual country name matching, aiding future data processing tasks.

### Pending Tasks
- Manually match country names using the generated [[CSV]] to ensure consistency across datasets.
