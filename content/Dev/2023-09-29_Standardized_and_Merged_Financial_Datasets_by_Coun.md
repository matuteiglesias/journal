**🏷️ Labels**: Data Merging, Python, Pandas, Data Aggregation, Financial Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to standardize country names across multiple datasets and perform data aggregation and merging by country and year. This was aimed at creating a unified dataset for financial analysis.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented [[Python]] code snippets to merge datasets using pandas, focusing on unifying the 'country' column.
- Developed a function to aggregate data by counting records for each group and summing financial columns.
- Standardized country names before merging to ensure consistency across datasets.
- Merged datasets by country and year, handling column name conflicts and summing total monetary values.
- Saved the processed and aggregated data into [[CSV]] files for further analysis.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully standardized country names and merged multiple datasets, resulting in a comprehensive dataset ready for financial analysis.
- Aggregated data by specified categories and years, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further debugging and validation of the merged dataset to ensure accuracy.
- Explore additional data sources for potential inclusion in the dataset.
