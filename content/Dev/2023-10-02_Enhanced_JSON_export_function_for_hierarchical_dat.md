### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance and optimize a [[JSON]] export function in [[Python]] to handle hierarchical data structures more effectively.

### Key Activities
- Modified a data update function to append new data points while avoiding unwanted columns.
- Implemented nesting of data by 'observable' and 'sintetico' categories using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].
- Conducted a code review and optimization of the [[JSON]] export function to eliminate variable duplication and redundancy.
- Designed a hierarchical [[JSON]] export function to organize data by 'observable' and 'sintetico', ensuring proper nesting and updates to existing records.
- Addressed a KeyError in the [[JSON]] export function by ensuring proper access to necessary columns before dropping them.
- Modified the [[JSON]] export function to handle quarterly data, ensuring each record represents a dictionary of quarters and their associated values.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the [[JSON]] export function to handle hierarchical data structures, improving data organization and processing efficiency.
- Resolved errors related to data access and column management, ensuring robust data handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[JSON]] export function with diverse datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- Consideration of additional data structures or formats that may benefit from similar optimization techniques.
