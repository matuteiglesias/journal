### Session Goal
The aim of this session was to refactor and enhance the [[JSON]] export function in [[Python]] to ensure data integrity and prevent overwriting of existing data.

### Key Activities
- Modified the [[JSON]] export function to prevent reinitialization of dictionaries, ensuring existing entries are preserved.
- Implemented logic to append new 'Q' values to existing dictionaries rather than creating new ones.
- Improved data structure logic to maintain a list of dictionaries for quarterly data.
- Updated key-value pairs in nested dictionaries to ensure correct data manipulation.
- Provided guidance on loading, accessing, and manipulating [[JSON]] data in [[Python]].
- Corrected data entry logic to prevent overwriting data for the same quarter.
- Fixed import errors by ensuring necessary modules like `copy` are imported for deep copying.
- Enhanced nested structure traversal in the [[JSON]] export function to avoid data loss.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the [[JSON]] export logic to maintain data integrity and prevent data duplication.
- Improved the handling of nested structures and data manipulation in [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[JSON]] export function to ensure all edge cases are handled.
- Documentation of the updated function logic for future reference.
