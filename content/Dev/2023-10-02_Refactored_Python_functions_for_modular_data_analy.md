**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, refactoring, data analysis, modularity, notebooks  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the modularity and maintainability of a [[data analysis]] project by refactoring [[Python]] functions, organizing notebooks, and addressing common [[Python]] errors.

### Key Activities
- **Markdown Commenting Shortcuts:** Explored keyboard shortcuts for commenting in various editors, noting limitations in online Markdown previewers.
- **Notebook Organization:** Provided insights and suggestions for organizing and optimizing notebooks, focusing on modularity and [[documentation]].
- **Modular Structure Planning:** Outlined a modular structure for a [[data analysis]] project, detailing code organization into logical units for better maintenance and reuse.
- **[[Error Handling]] in [[Python]]:** Addressed `ImportError` and `NameError` issues, providing solutions for troubleshooting and modifying functions to accept external arguments.
- **Code Review and Refactoring:** Conducted a code review, suggesting improvements for data loading functions, and recommended refactoring functions to enhance reusability by accepting global variables as arguments.
- **Data Collection Workflow:** Described a [[workflow]] for collecting and processing socioeconomic statistics in Argentina, including data sources, methodologies, and [[data processing]] stages.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored functions to improve reusability and clarity.
- Developed a structured plan for organizing code and notebooks in a modular fashion.
- Identified and resolved common [[Python]] errors, enhancing code reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed modular structure in the [[data analysis]] project.
- Continue refining the [[documentation]] and organization of notebooks for optimal performance.
