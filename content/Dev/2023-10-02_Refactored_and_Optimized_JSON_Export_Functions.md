## üìÖ 2023-10-02 ‚Äî Session: Refactored and Optimized JSON Export Functions

**üïí 19:35‚Äì20:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, JSON, Data Processing, Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The session aimed to address issues with [[JSON]] export functions, improve data processing efficiency, and enhance modularity in [[Python]] scripts.

**Key Activities**:
1. **Fixing [[JSON]] Export Function Issues**: Addressed problems with empty dictionaries and duplicate keys in the [[JSON]] export function.
2. **[[JSON]] [[Data Processing]] for Quarterly Reports**: Developed a structured approach to process quarterly data and merge [[JSON]] structures, ensuring no duplicates.
3. **[[Data Processing]] Structure and Efficiency**: Improved workflow efficiency by emphasizing unique filenames and nested loops for multiple datasets.
4. **Filename Generation for [[JSON]] Export**: Suggested solutions for unique filenames to prevent overwriting.
5. **Hierarchical Data Merging in [[Python]]**: Implemented a two-step process for generating and merging hierarchical data structures.
6. **Optimized [[JSON]] Merging Function**: Enhanced the `merge_jsons` function to append new data while preserving existing entries.
7. **Refactored Function for Hierarchical [[JSON]] Export**: Enhanced modularity by separating data processing from file I/O operations.
8. **Modification of merge_jsons Function**: Improved data integration by merging Q-values directly into existing structures.
9. **Adding Status Updates to [[Data Processing]] Script**: Included print statements for better visibility and debugging.

**Achievements**: Successfully refactored and optimized the [[JSON]] export functions, improved data processing workflows, and enhanced script modularity and debugging capabilities.

**Pending Tasks**: None identified; the session objectives were completed.
