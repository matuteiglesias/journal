- Investigated JavaScript for data handling in graphs, analyzing minified code for key features.
- Created and integrated a card-based display for data visualization using HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully resolved multiple Git merge conflicts in Jupyter Notebooks using both manual and tool-assisted methods.
- Developed and tested a dietary log template in markdown format.
- Enhanced understanding of JavaScript data handling and visualization techniques.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further explore advanced conflict resolution tools and techniques for Git.
- Continue refining the dietary log template for broader use cases.
