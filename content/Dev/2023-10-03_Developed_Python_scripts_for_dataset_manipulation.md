## 📅 2023-10-03 — Session: Developed Python scripts for dataset manipulation

**🕒 16:10–16:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Data Manipulation, Dataframes, Scripting  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective was to develop [[Python]] scripts for efficient loading, processing, and manipulation of datasets using the pandas library.

### Key Activities
- Loaded datasets using pandas, iterating through multiple files to load the first 5 rows based on source, unit, and time combinations.
- Implemented a loop to check file existence and load datasets accordingly.
- Iterated through datasets to print filenames and display grouped data excluding specific columns.
- Displayed group sizes within the 'GID' column using the `size()` method.
- Concatenated DataFrames horizontally by organizing them with unit names.
- Set filenames as column names during DataFrame concatenation for better organization.

### Achievements
Successfully developed scripts to handle dataset loading, processing, and manipulation tasks, improving data handling efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
No pending tasks identified.
