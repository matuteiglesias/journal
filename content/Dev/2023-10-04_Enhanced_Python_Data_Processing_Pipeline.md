## 📅 2023-10-04 — Session: Enhanced Python Data Processing Pipeline

**🕒 00:25–01:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Code Refactoring, JSON, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:** Enhance the [[Python]] [[data processing]] pipeline for improved efficiency and clarity.

**Key Activities:**
- Modified a [[data processing]] script to reset data after processing each grouper and load existing data files, preventing overwriting during quarterly processing.
- Refactored a [[Python]] function to streamline [[data processing]] based on groupers and base string settings, reducing code duplication.
- Unified iteration over base strings using a mapping dictionary to enhance code readability and efficiency.
- Revised data grouping in [[JSON]] processing to ensure updates are specific to each base string and grouper combination.
- Updated the `merge_jsons` function to improve [[JSON]] data merging by correctly updating existing quarter values.
- Implemented data segregation between `groupersP` and `groupersH` to ensure distinct data merging.
- Developed a [[Python]] function to generate quarterly dates using `dateutil.relativedelta`.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully enhanced the [[data processing]] pipeline with improved code clarity and efficiency.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the updated functions to ensure robustness in various data scenarios.
