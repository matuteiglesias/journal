**üïí 22:40‚Äì23:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Python, Merging, Serialization, Debugging  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to address and fix issues related to [[JSON]] merging and serialization in [[Python]], ensuring data integrity and correct handling of data structures.

### Key Activities
- **Empanada Recipe**: Briefly reviewed a traditional empanada recipe, focusing on cooking techniques and ingredient tips.
- **[[JSON]] Merging**: Identified and fixed a problem with merging hierarchical [[JSON]] structures, specifically preventing duplicate grouper values.
- **Code Execution**: Attempted to execute and refine the [[JSON]] merging process, addressing code execution issues.
- **Recursive Merging Function**: Developed a recursive function for merging [[JSON]] structures, ensuring data integrity.
- **Custom Serialization**: Implemented custom serialization and deserialization techniques using [[Python]]'s `JSONEncoder`, maintaining boolean case and handling specific data types.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[JSON]] merging issues by implementing a recursive merging function.
- Developed custom serialization and deserialization methods to handle [[Python]]-specific data types effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the [[JSON]] merging and serialization functions in different scenarios to ensure robustness.
