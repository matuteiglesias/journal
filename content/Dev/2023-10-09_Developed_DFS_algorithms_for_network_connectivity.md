### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and develop algorithms using Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine network connectivity and identify critical disconnections or 'bridges' in graph structures.

### Key Activities
- **DFS Algorithms for Network Connectivity**: Detailed the implementation of two DFS-based algorithms to assess network connectivity and identify isolated nodes due to attacks, with a time complexity of O(|C|).
- **Bridge Identification in Graphs**: Explained the process of identifying critical edges or 'bridges' in a graph that, if removed, would increase the number of connected components. This was achieved by using a DFS-based approach, improving efficiency over executing multiple DFS runs.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Provided a detailed breakdown of the algorithm's complexity, focusing on the use of discovery and low arrays to determine back cycles and bridge conditions.
- **[[Optimization]] of `amigos_debajo` Function**: Discussed and implemented memoization to optimize the `amigos_debajo` function, reducing redundant calculations and improving performance.
- **Pseudocode [[Development]]**: Developed pseudocode for calculating friends beneath a node in a DFS tree, utilizing set operations for efficient combination of child nodes' friends.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and analyzed DFS algorithms for network connectivity and bridge identification.
- Optimized existing functions using memoization techniques.
- Developed clear pseudocode for recursive DFS operations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the optimized `amigos_debajo` function in different graph scenarios.
- Exploration of additional optimization techniques for DFS algorithms.
