**üïí 00:40‚Äì03:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Automation, Scripting, Descriptive Statistics  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to automate [[data processing]] tasks by integrating [[Python]] scripts for file management, [[data processing]], and descriptive statistics analysis.

### Key Activities
- **File Check and Script Execution**: Developed a [[workflow]] to check for required files in the main repository and execute a sampling script from a secondary repository if files are missing.
- **Command [[Integration]]**: Integrated a command to execute the `samplear.py` script, including file existence checks and logging for processing census data.
- **Quarterly Date Generation**: Updated a function for generating quarterly dates and refactored the main code to use this function.
- **Looping Through Years**: Demonstrated how to call an external script in a loop for each year within a specified range using the subprocess module.
- **Directory Restoration**: Modified a [[Python]] script to ensure the working directory is restored after executing an external script.
- **Code Structure Overview**: Provided an overview of structured code within Jupyter Notebook files for configuration and main [[data processing]] tasks.
- **Descriptive Statistics Framework**: Outlined a structured framework for a Jupyter notebook focused on descriptive statistics.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated [[automation]] scripts for [[data processing]] and management.
- Established a structured framework for descriptive statistics analysis in Jupyter notebooks.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the [[data processing]] scripts to enhance efficiency and scalability.
- Additional testing of the integrated scripts to ensure robustness and [[error handling]].
