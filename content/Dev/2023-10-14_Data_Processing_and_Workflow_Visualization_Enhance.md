**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[data processing]] workflows and improve the visualization of these processes through various tools and techniques.

### Key Activities
- Developed a high-level architecture and data dictionary for software components, focusing on data flow and [[documentation]].
- Completed [[data processing]] in notebooks, including descriptive statistics and geospatial data handling.
- Created detailed data flow and processing schemas for multiple notebooks, focusing on poverty metrics and synthetic populations.
- Addressed graph rendering issues by generating [[workflow]] graphs as images for better accessibility.
- Utilized Graphviz to create and modify [[workflow]] diagrams, improving clarity by differentiating styles for notebooks and datasets.
- Corrected node definitions in [[workflow]] diagrams using DOT language to enhance visual representation.
- Discussed model compatibility issues with scikit-learn versions and provided strategies for handling them.

### Achievements
- Successfully processed and documented data across multiple notebooks.
- Generated and enhanced [[workflow]] visualizations using Graphviz, improving the clarity and accessibility of [[data processing]] workflows.
- Identified and corrected issues in [[workflow]] diagram representations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of model versioning strategies to ensure compatibility across different scikit-learn versions.
