## üìÖ 2023-10-14 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization and Processing in Python

**üïí 18:20‚Äì20:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Modularization, Documentation, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[data processing]] and visualization capabilities using [[Python]], focusing on modularization, [[documentation]], and effective plotting techniques.

### Key Activities
- **Documentation Essentials**: Reviewed key [[documentation]] practices for resource-limited projects, emphasizing the importance of README files, inline comments, and architecture diagrams.
- **[[Data Processing]] Adjustments**: Implemented code adjustments to include `base_str` in unique combinations for [[data processing]], ensuring accurate iteration over unique pairs.
- **DataFrame Manipulation**: Modified DataFrame operations to handle multiple groupers and applied filtering using compound boolean masks.
- **Modularization**: Refactored code to create a `get_data_subset` function, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Time Series Plotting**: Developed a `plot_time_series()` function for visualizing time series data, processing multiple files for unique pairs.
- **[[Data Visualization]] Enhancements**: Created subplots for CBA and CBT data, updated plotting code for economic indicators, and ensured consistent color mapping across plots.
- **Advanced Plotting Techniques**: Incorporated moving averages and median-based plots, with filled areas between percentiles for statistical analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully modularized data retrieval processes and enhanced code clarity.
- Improved visualization techniques with consistent color mapping and advanced plotting features.
- Updated [[documentation]] practices for better [[project management]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of modularized functions in different data scenarios.
- Exploration of additional visualization techniques for complex datasets.
