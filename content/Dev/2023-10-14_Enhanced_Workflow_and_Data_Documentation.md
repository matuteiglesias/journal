## 📅 2023-10-14 — Session: Enhanced Workflow and Data Documentation

**🕒 22:15–22:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: workflow, data documentation, Graphviz, datasets, Jupyter  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to update and enhance the data [[workflow]], improve visualization clarity, and establish guidelines for data [[documentation]].

**Key Activities:**
- Divided the [[workflow]] into two separate notebooks: 'Cálculo de Pobreza' and 'Estadísticas Descriptivas'. Updated the Graphviz diagram to reflect these changes.
- Enhanced the [[workflow]] diagram for dataset processing, including nodes for datasets and links between processes.
- Updated graph visualization to represent initial datasets as individual gray nodes for improved clarity.
- Reflected on dataset relationships in Jupyter notebooks, detailing input and output datasets for various processes.
- Reviewed geospatial data management and Mapbox integration notebooks, summarizing dataset relationships and outputs.
- Specified datasets for a [[workflow]] in a directed graph format, outlining relationships between data sources and notebooks.
- Outlined guidelines for minimal data [[documentation]], emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and maintainability.
- Created a streamlined guide for concise data [[documentation]], focusing on essential elements such as project overview and datasets.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully updated and clarified the data [[workflow]] and visualization.
- Established comprehensive and concise guidelines for data [[documentation]].

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refinement of the [[workflow]] diagrams and [[documentation]] may be needed as new datasets or processes are introduced.
