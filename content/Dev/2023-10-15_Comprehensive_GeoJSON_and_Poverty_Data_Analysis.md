### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and document various datasets related to GeoJSON files and poverty metrics in Argentina, focusing on data structure, documentation, and analysis methods.

### Key Activities
- **GeoJSON Extraction**: Utilized `ogrinfo` from the GDAL suite to extract column information from GeoJSON files.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Addressed a KeyError in [[Python]] dictionary access, ensuring keys are strings.
- **Dataset [[Documentation]]**: Documented datasets related to geographical and poverty metrics in Argentina, including GeoJSON structures, poverty analysis, and synthetic population datasets.
- **[[Data Processing]] [[Documentation]]**: Revised documentation on data processing tools and methods, emphasizing feature engineering and geospatial integration.
- **Algorithm Evaluation**: Evaluated algorithmic responses related to graph theory and search algorithms, providing insights and suggestions for improvement.

### Achievements
- Successfully documented the structure and key variables of GeoJSON files for poverty analysis in Argentina.
- Resolved KeyError issues in [[Python]], improving data access reliability.
- Enhanced understanding of data processing and documentation standards, particularly in geospatial contexts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further clarify the types of analysis or queries to be conducted with the GeoJSON poverty data in Argentina.
- Continue refining the documentation structure for data processing to ensure clarity and consistency.
