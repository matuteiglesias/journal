### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine statistical models for analyzing tax morale and execute [[data visualization]] tasks using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Reviewed independent variables and methodologies in taxation research, focusing on state services and community capabilities.
- Outlined ordered logistic model formulas, considering versions with and without city fixed effects.
- Developed a refined ordered logistic model for tax morale, incorporating controls like satisfaction with tax revenue use and public goods delivery.
- Suggested regression models for analyzing tax morale based on public goods, community engagement, and political participation.
- Executed [[Python]] code for integrating codebook information into histogram plotting and loading [[JSON]] into a [[Python]] dictionary.
- Modified [[Python]] code for enhanced [[data visualization]], including legend improvements and Markdown formatting.
- Addressed errors in dataset loading, including library imports, file path corrections, and dataset reloading.
- Updated heatmap modifications by rounding numbers and removing black lines.

### Achievements
- Successfully refined statistical models for tax morale analysis.
- Improved [[data visualization]] techniques in [[Python]].
- Resolved dataset loading errors and confirmed correct file paths.

### Pending Tasks
- Verify the correctness of dataset loading and ensure all necessary libraries are imported.
- Continue refining [[data visualization]] techniques and explore additional model refinements.
