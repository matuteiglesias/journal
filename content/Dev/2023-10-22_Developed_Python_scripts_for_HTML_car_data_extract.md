**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts to extract car information from HTML content using web scraping techniques.

### Key Activities
- **HTML Element Extraction**: Identified key elements such as title, description, specifications, image, and price from a car listing's HTML source.
- **[[Python]] Script [[Development]]**: Developed a [[Python]] script using BeautifulSoup to extract car information, including title, description, specifications, price, image, and location.
- **HTML Content Fetching**: Implemented a method to fetch HTML content using the `requests` library for parsing with BeautifulSoup, correcting a common mistake of passing URLs directly to BeautifulSoup.
- **Recursive HTML Tree Printing**: Created a function to recursively print HTML document structures, improving understanding of tag hierarchies.
- **Code Correction and Enhancement**: Corrected and enhanced a BeautifulSoup function to print tag structures with improved visibility, including tag names, associated classes, and direct text content.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed scripts to extract detailed car information from HTML using [[Python]] and BeautifulSoup.
- Improved understanding and visibility of HTML tag structures, aiding future web scraping tasks.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the scripts on diverse car listing HTML sources to ensure robustness and accuracy.
