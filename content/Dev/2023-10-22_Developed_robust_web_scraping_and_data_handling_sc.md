## 📅 2023-10-22 — Session: Developed robust web scraping and data handling scripts

**🕒 01:30–02:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Web Scraping, Python, Beautifulsoup, Data Handling, Error Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance and refine web scraping techniques for extracting product details from webpages and handling the data efficiently.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented [[Python]] scripts using BeautifulSoup and requests to extract product details such as title, description, image URL, product URL, and price from webpages.
- Developed methods to extract Open Graph and Twitter meta tag descriptions using BeautifulSoup.
- Created a [[Python]] implementation for scraping product details from multiple URLs and storing results in a pandas DataFrame.
- Enhanced error handling in web scraping scripts to manage invalid URLs and None values.
- Resolved AttributeError issues in DataFrame creation by filtering out None values.
- Implemented a `parse_price` function to extract currency and value from price strings using regular expressions.
- Adjusted regular expressions to fix currency parsing issues in price strings.
- Demonstrated parsing of 'Price' column in DataFrame to separate currency and value into distinct columns.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully developed and refined web scraping scripts for product detail extraction.
- Improved data handling and error management in [[Python]] scripts.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the implemented scripts to ensure robustness across different webpages.
