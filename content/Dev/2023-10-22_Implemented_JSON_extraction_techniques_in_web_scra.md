## üìÖ 2023-10-22 ‚Äî Session: Implemented JSON extraction techniques in web scraping

**üïí 01:00‚Äì01:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Web Scraping, Python, JavaScript, BeautifulSoup  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to explore and implement various methods for extracting [[JSON]] data embedded within HTML and [[JavaScript]] content using [[Python]] and [[JavaScript]].

**Key Activities:**
1. **HTML and [[JSON]] Extraction:** Utilized [[Python]] with BeautifulSoup to extract [[JSON]] data from `<script>` tags in HTML content. Regular expressions were employed to handle cases where [[JSON]] data was not in expected tags.
2. **[[JavaScript]] [[JSON]] Handling:** Addressed [[JSON]] extraction from [[JavaScript]] variables like `window.__PRELOADED_STATE__`, including [[error handling]] for truncated [[JSON]].
3. **Error Correction:** Corrected library import oversights and variable loss issues in [[JavaScript]] to ensure successful [[JSON]] extraction.
4. **Product Metadata Extraction:** Developed methods to extract product metadata such as title, description, image URL, and product URL from HTML.
5. **[[Python]] Script Development:** Created a [[Python]] script leveraging BeautifulSoup for automated web scraping of product details.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented techniques for [[JSON]] data extraction from both HTML and [[JavaScript]].
- Resolved errors related to library imports and variable handling.
- Developed a reusable [[Python]] script for web scraping tasks.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refine [[error handling]] mechanisms for truncated [[JSON]] data.
- Optimize regular expression patterns for more robust [[JSON]] extraction.
