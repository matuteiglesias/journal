## 📅 2023-10-23 — Session: Developed advanced correlation functions in Pandas

**🕒 22:10–23:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Data Analysis, Correlation, Data Cleaning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The goal of this session was to enhance [[data analysis]] capabilities by developing advanced correlation functions using [[Python]]'s [[Pandas]] library.

### Key Activities:
- Implemented a function to compute correlations of a specified column with all other columns in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame.
- Developed a method to compute correlations using MultiIndex for better organization of results.
- Explored the use of the `min_periods` parameter to ensure correlations are calculated only with sufficient data.
- Created a function to handle missing values in correlation calculations, ensuring robust results.
- Implemented a function to compute correlations considering only non-missing values.
- Developed a function to find equivalent time series based on correlation thresholds.

### Achievements:
- Successfully developed multiple functions that enhance the ability to analyze correlations in data, accommodating various data integrity and organization requirements.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and validation of the developed functions in diverse datasets to ensure reliability and performance.
