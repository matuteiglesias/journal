**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing electoral data, focusing on ecological inference and voter segmentation.

### Key Activities
- **[[Data Analysis]] Planning**: Identified necessary datasets and proposed analyses for electoral results, including ecological inference and voter segmentation.
- **Data Structuring**: Outlined the structure of datasets required for electoral analysis, covering voter participation and socioeconomic indicators.
- **Notebook Proposals**: Developed ideas for notebooks to analyze electoral results, including geographic and candidate performance analysis.
- **Collaborative Tools Exploration**: Reviewed tools for collaborative work on Jupyter Notebooks, such as VS Code Live Share, Google Colab, and JupyterHub.
- **Google Colab Instructions**: Provided guides on managing files in Google Colab, including [[CSV]] handling and Google Drive integration.
- **[[Pandas]] [[Optimization]]**: Reflected on code structure for electoral analysis using [[Pandas]], emphasizing optimization and documentation.

### Achievements
- Established a clear framework for conducting electoral data analysis, including the use of ecological inference.
- Created a structured approach for developing analysis notebooks, enhancing collaboration and data handling.
- Improved understanding of collaborative tools and data management in Google Colab.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed notebook structures in actual data analysis projects.
- Further explore collaborative features in JupyterHub for large-scale projects.
- Continue optimizing data handling processes in [[Pandas]] for efficiency.
