## 📅 2023-10-26 — Session: Enhanced Time Series Data Visualization in Python

**🕒 20:05–21:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Time Series, Matplotlib, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance and refine the process of creating time series plots using [[Python]], focusing on improving visualization techniques and data management.

### Key Activities
- Developed a step-by-step guide for creating time series plots from [[CSV]] data using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]].
- Implemented a script to handle the plotting of time series data, including scatter plots, moving averages, and percentile shading.
- Updated the `plot_time_series` function to enhance its capabilities, including conditional checks for quantiles and specific cases.
- Created plots by grouping data based on specific columns, such as the 'AGLOSI' column, to visualize different groups within the dataset.
- Adjusted [[data visualization]] techniques by modifying rolling averages, y-axis limits, line styles, and color manipulations to improve clarity.
- Solved color adjustment issues by converting RGB to HLS and back to RGB to handle TypeErrors.
- Expanded the `files_info` dictionary to better manage time series data attributes for analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented enhanced visualization techniques for time series data.
- Improved data management strategies for handling time series data attributes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated plotting functions and scripts in diverse datasets.
- Exploration of additional customization options for time series plots to cater to specific analytical needs.
