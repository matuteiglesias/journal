**üïí 21:55‚Äì22:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Unix Commands, Google Cloud, Python, Data Storage, Remote Access  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore Unix command line utilities for disk usage management and integrate [[Google Cloud]] services with [[Python]] for enhanced data storage solutions.

### Key Activities
- **Unix Command Exploration**: Utilized the `du` command to check and sort disk usage in Unix-based systems. This included using wildcards to display disk usage of all files and directories.
- **Remote Access Techniques**: Reflected on the use of SCP and SSH for secure file transfer and remote server access, focusing on best practices for data storage.
- **[[Google Cloud]] [[Integration]]**: Implemented solutions using [[Google Cloud]] Storage and SQL with [[Python]] and pandas, including setup and library installation.
- **Project Naming**: Suggested project names for a [[Google Cloud]] initiative focused on poverty mapping in Argentina.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into Unix command line utilities for effective disk management.
- Clarified the use of SCP and SSH for secure data storage.
- Successfully outlined steps for integrating [[Google Cloud]] services with [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of [[Google Cloud]] SQL features and their integration with existing systems.
- Finalizing a project name for the [[Google Cloud]] initiative on poverty mapping.
