## üìÖ 2023-10-29 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

**üïí 17:30‚Äì18:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Visualization, Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statistics  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Python]] libraries such as Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]], focusing on income statistics by province.

### Key Activities
- **Box Plot Creation**: Initiated with a guide on creating a box plot using Seaborn, covering quartile calculations and plot customization.
- **Data Series Request**: Addressed a reset in the code execution environment by requesting the data series again for plotting.
- **Statistical Data Request**: Sought data on medians and percentiles for plotting.
- **Scatter Plot Development**: Provided a code snippet for a scatter plot with IQR bars using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn.
- **Customizable Plotting**: Developed a customizable plot for income statistics, including data preparation and visualization adjustments.
- **Engineering Notation Formatting**: Created a plot with the y-axis in engineering notation for better readability.
- **DataFrame Filtering**: Implemented a method to filter a [[Pandas]] DataFrame by date and conditions.
- **Marker Size Adjustment**: Adjusted scatter plot marker sizes based on population size.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and customized various plots for visualizing income statistics by province.
- Implemented engineering notation for axis formatting, enhancing readability.
- Developed methods to dynamically adjust plot features based on data characteristics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced customization options in Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]].
- [[Integration]] of additional statistical measures for comprehensive data analysis.
