## üìÖ 2023-11-01 ‚Äî Session: Developed Data Visualization for Voting Analysis

**üïí 19:20‚Äì20:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Visualization, Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Voting Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[data visualization]] techniques for analyzing voting patterns across different income levels and political parties using [[Python]] libraries such as [[Pandas]], Seaborn, and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities
- **Identified Column Differences**: Used set operations to identify differences in column names across multiple DataFrames.
- **Data Manipulation**: Added cumulative percentage variables to the 'circuitos' table for electors by number and income.
- **Boxplot Creation**: Developed a Seaborn boxplot to visualize voting percentages across income levels, with enhancements for color mapping and aesthetics.
- **Aesthetic Enhancements**: Improved plot aesthetics by adjusting themes, color palettes, and font settings.
- **Code Environment Management**: Reset the code execution environment and re-imported necessary packages.
- **Data Management**: Requested re-upload of essential datasets and identified issues with undefined datasets.
- **Subplot Creation**: Created subplots to visualize voting patterns for multiple political parties.

### Achievements
- Successfully visualized voting patterns using boxplots and subplots, enhancing the understanding of voting trends across different demographics.
- Addressed technical warnings and improved the aesthetic quality of the visualizations.

### Pending Tasks
- Define the 'data_filtered' dataset to ensure all visualizations can be executed without errors.
- Re-upload missing datasets ('circuitos.csv' and 'votos.csv') to restore full functionality.
