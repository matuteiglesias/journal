## üìÖ 2023-11-01 ‚Äî Session: Resolved Plotting and Data Processing Issues

**üïí 15:25‚Äì16:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Debugging, Code Optimization, Data Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and fix issues related to plotting functions and data processing in [[Python]], focusing on group indexing in plotting, debugging [[Matplotlib]] scatter plots, and optimizing data processing code.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing Group Indexing in Plotting Function**: Adapted code to handle group indexing by summing `votos_cantidad` for each group, enhancing visual representation.
- **[[Debugging]] [[Matplotlib]] Scatter Plot**: Conducted a systematic debugging process to resolve marker size issues, ensuring proper value checks and parameter adjustments.
- **Resolving Warnings in Scatter Function**: Addressed warnings related to keyword arguments and array comparisons in [[Python]] plotting.
- **Streamlining [[Python]] Code**: Reorganized data processing code into clear sections for aggregation, verification, merging, and analysis, improving readability and maintenance.
- **Electoral [[Data Analysis]] in Markdown**: Provided a detailed guide for electoral data analysis, covering data preparation, verification, merging, and specific vote fraction calculations.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed group indexing and marker size issues in plotting functions.
- Resolved warnings in [[Python]] code, ensuring more robust and error-free execution.
- Enhanced data processing code structure for better efficiency and maintainability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the optimized data processing code to ensure stability across different datasets.
- Additional enhancements in plotting functions for more complex visualizations if needed.
