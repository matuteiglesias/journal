## 📅 2023-11-02 — Session: Customized Seaborn Boxplots for Voting Patterns

**🕒 02:00–02:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Seaborn, Boxplot, Data Visualization, Python, Matplotlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to customize the appearance of Seaborn boxplots to visually represent voting patterns across different political parties and income levels.

### Key Activities
- Customized boxplot appearance using Seaborn by adjusting box face transparency and edge colors.
- Addressed Seaborn version compatibility issues by manually setting facecolors due to the unrecognized `fill` parameter.
- Resolved `SettingWithCopyWarning` in DataFrame and prepared data for visualization.
- Debugged `IndexError` in color assignment by checking list lengths and implementing [[error handling]].
- Adapted code to dynamically calculate components per group and ensure proper color indexing.
- Modified boxplot code to reflect party differences without separating by election type.
- Applied specific colors to error bars to match box edges for visual consistency.

### Achievements
- Successfully customized boxplots with transparent faces and colored edges.
- Ensured compatibility with different Seaborn versions.
- Improved [[error handling]] and data preparation for visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the visualization to enhance clarity and insight into voting patterns.
