## 📅 2023-11-02 — Session: Developed Custom Boxplots for Voting Analysis

**🕒 02:30–02:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Voting Patterns  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and customize [[Python]] scripts for visualizing voting patterns across different regions using boxplots. The focus was on comparing agglomerates 32 and 33 against others.

### Key Activities
- Implemented [[Python]] scripts using Seaborn and [[Matplotlib]] to create 2x3 grid boxplots for visual comparison of voting patterns.
- Addressed indentation issues in plotting scripts to ensure proper execution within loops.
- Customized x-axis tick labels to display values from 0 to 9 consistently.
- Modified legends to include additional context (' - diff') for clarity.
- Resolved legend issues by creating custom handles with [[Matplotlib]] patches.

### Achievements
- Successfully visualized voting patterns for specified agglomerates with customized legends and consistent axis labels.
- Improved code robustness by fixing indentation and legend issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of visualizations to incorporate additional data insights or user feedback as needed.
