## 📅 2023-11-02 — Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Matplotlib

**🕒 03:00–03:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Visualization, Python, Annotations  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data visualization techniques using [[Matplotlib]], focusing on customizing boxplots, conditional x-axis adjustments, and adding annotations to graphs.

### Key Activities
- Developed a solution for customizing the placement of boxplots in [[Matplotlib]] to overcome Seaborn's limitations, including handling missing data points.
- Created [[Python]] code snippets to conditionally set x-axis ticks and labels in [[Matplotlib]] based on row indices in subplots.
- Added annotations and epigraphs to graphs using [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn, with a focus on highlighting voting trends in the AMBA region.
- Provided a structured epigraph template for analyzing vote distribution by income and party in Argentina.
- Adjusted graph sizes and spacing in [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn for improved data visualization.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented customized boxplot placements and conditional x-axis settings.
- Enhanced graphs with annotations and epigraphs to convey complex data insights.
- Improved overall graph aesthetics and clarity through size and spacing adjustments.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced data visualization techniques in [[Matplotlib]] and Seaborn to continue enhancing the clarity and impact of visual data presentations.
