## üìÖ 2023-11-02 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization with Python

**üïí 15:25‚Äì16:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Error Correction, Matplotlib, Code Optimization  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on improving data visualization techniques using [[Python]], specifically targeting the enhancement of plotting capabilities and error correction in data manipulation.

### Key Activities
- Modified graph generation code to include percentage formatting, line styles, and specific markers for different data groups.
- Addressed and corrected syntax errors in marker assignments within a data plotting loop.
- Provided guidance on extracting and utilizing DataFrame values for grouping operations, ensuring correct usage of the `file_info['grouper']` for unique value grouping.
- Resolved DataFrame indexing errors by suggesting the use of `.loc[]` or direct column access instead of `.iloc[]`.
- Improved method for accessing 'base' column values in grouped DataFrames, emphasizing direct access methods.
- Developed a compact code version for group plotting, integrating warning checks for unique 'base' values.
- Conducted a final code review, providing feedback on structure, readability, and debugging practices.
- Added annotations to [[Matplotlib]] plots to mark specific events, such as start dates of presidents, using the `ax.annotate()` function.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the efficiency and readability of the plotting code.
- Corrected multiple errors in data manipulation and visualization processes.

### Pending Tasks
- No pending tasks were identified during this session.
