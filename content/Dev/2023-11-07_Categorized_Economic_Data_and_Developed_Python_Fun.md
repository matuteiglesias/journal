## üìÖ 2023-11-07 ‚Äî Session: Categorized Economic Data and Developed Python Functions

**üïí 04:10‚Äì05:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: economic data, categorization, Python, DataFrame, macroeconomics  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to organize economic data into thematic categories and develop [[Python]] functions to manage and analyze this data effectively.

### Key Activities
- **Categorizaci√≥n de Temas de Series de Tiempo del Ministerio de Econom√≠a:** Developed an initial thematic categorization for organizing time series data from the Ministry of Economy into major themes and subthemes.
- **Categorization of Economic Distributions for Macroeconomics:** Created a categorization framework focusing on GDP, Global Supply and Demand, and Sectoral Gross Value Added to highlight key economic indicators.
- **Correction of DataFrame Example Data:** Identified and corrected an error in a DataFrame constructor example, ensuring consistent array lengths.
- **[[Python]] Function for Metadata Summary:** Developed a [[Python]] function to retrieve and print summary information for a specific `distribucion_id` from a DataFrame, detailing unique and non-unique values.
- **Categorization of Economic Data Distributions:** Structured economic data distributions into themes such as Economic Activity and Growth, Labor Market, and Sectoral Analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a comprehensive categorization framework for economic data.
- Developed and tested [[Python]] functions for data manipulation and metadata summarization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the categorization framework to include additional economic indicators.
- Validation of [[Python]] functions on larger datasets to ensure robustness.
