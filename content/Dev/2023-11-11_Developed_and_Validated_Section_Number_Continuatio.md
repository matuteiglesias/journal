## 📅 2023-11-11 — Session: Developed and Validated Section Number Continuation Function

**🕒 02:20–02:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: function, validation, programming, section numbers, text processing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary aim of this session was to implement and validate a function named `valid_continuation` that generates valid continuations for section numbers in a document.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed the `valid_continuation` function to generate valid section number continuations.
- Implemented the `is_valid_continuation` function to validate section numbers, filtering invalid entries from parsed data.
- Reprocessed text snippets to generate a list of section numbers and their validity status.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented the `valid_continuation` function and demonstrated its usage in creating a boolean list for section validation.
- Validated the functionality of the `is_valid_continuation` function with examples, ensuring accurate distinction between valid and invalid continuations.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Address inaccuracies in the validation function as highlighted in the list of section numbers and their validity status, which requires further refinement.
