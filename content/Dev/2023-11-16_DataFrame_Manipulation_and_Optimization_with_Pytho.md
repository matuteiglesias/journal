## üìÖ 2023-11-16 ‚Äî Session: DataFrame Manipulation and Optimization with Python

**üïí 20:30‚Äì22:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, DataFrame, Optimization, Pandas, NumPy  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to manipulate and optimize data structures using [[Python]], focusing on DataFrame operations and quadratic [[optimization]].

### Key Activities:
- **DataFrame Filtering**: Implemented a [[Python]] script to filter unrelated course pairs in the lower triangle of a DataFrame using [[Pandas]].
- **Quadratic Optimization**: Utilized cvxpy to solve a quadratic [[optimization]] problem for assigning levels to subjects, aligning with a correlation matrix.
- **Data Replacement**: Replaced values in a DataFrame greater than 100 in absolute value with NaN using [[Pandas]]' `applymap`.
- **Term Differences Calculation**: Created a square matrix to calculate differences in academic terms between subjects using [[Pandas]] and NumPy.
- **Lower Triangle Calculation**: Calculated the lower triangle of the difference between DataFrames and replaced zeros with NaN for better visualization.

### Achievements:
- Successfully filtered and manipulated DataFrames for course data.
- Applied quadratic [[optimization]] to educational data, enhancing curriculum analysis.
- Improved data clarity by replacing out-of-range values with NaN.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further exploration of [[optimization]] techniques for curriculum development.
- Implementation of more complex data filtering and manipulation strategies.
