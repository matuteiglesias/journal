## üìÖ 2023-11-16 ‚Äî Session: Optimized Course Assignment Using Graph Algorithms

**üïí 16:00‚Äì18:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Optimization, Graph Theory, Academic Scheduling, Data Science, Networkx  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to explore and optimize various academic and data-related problems using advanced algorithmic approaches and align research papers with institutional specializations.

### Key Activities:
1. **Research Alignment:** Analyzed the alignment of the paper 'Debunking Granularity: A Comprehensive Analysis of Aggregate Volatility' with institutional research specializations, focusing on interdisciplinary connections and departmental interests.
2. **Paper Summary:** Provided a structured summary of the paper on aggregate volatility, detailing its main theme, methodology, structure, and institutional relevance.
3. **[[Optimization]] Planning:** Explored optimization strategies for course organization using graph theory, linear programming, rule-based systems, genetic algorithms, and classification algorithms.
4. **Graph [[Optimization]]:** Developed strategies for optimizing the modeling of course prerequisites using adjacency matrices and directed graphs, employing topological sorting, shortest paths, quadratic optimization, and clustering techniques.
5. **Level Assignment [[Optimization]]:** Formulated a formal approach to minimize discrepancies in course level assignments, defining variables, objective functions, constraints, and solution adjustments.
6. **DataFrame Correlation Propagation:** Implemented a method to propagate course prerequisites in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame using NetworkX and shortest path algorithms, providing a code outline.

### Achievements:
- Successfully aligned research papers with institutional goals.
- Developed comprehensive optimization frameworks for academic scheduling and course assignments.
- Implemented a code-based solution for propagating course prerequisites in data structures.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further refine the optimization algorithms for course scheduling.
- Validate the implementation of the DataFrame correlation propagation method.
