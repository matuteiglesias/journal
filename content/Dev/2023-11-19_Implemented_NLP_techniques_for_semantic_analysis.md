**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: NLP, Python, Text Processing, Semantic Analysis, spaCy  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to implement and explore various Natural Language Processing ([[NLP]]) techniques for semantic analysis, focusing on text processing and analysis of the term 'docentes'.

### Key Activities:
- **Exporting Word Counts to [[CSV]]**: Utilized [[Python]] and the pandas library to convert word counts into a DataFrame and export them to a [[CSV]] file.
- **Text Processing**: Replaced ellipses in text to ensure proper word separation.
- **[[NLP]] Techniques Overview**: Reviewed key [[NLP]] methods such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition for analyzing speeches.
- **Semantic Analysis Framework**: Developed a framework for semantic understanding using part-of-speech tagging and contextual word relationships.
- **Text File Preparation**: Created a text file 'docentes_context.txt' for semantic analysis.
- **[[Python]] Script Execution**: Implemented a script to extract sentences containing 'docentes' for context analysis.
- **POS Tagging Strategy**: Planned a [[strategy]] for POS tagging using spaCy for analyzing 'docentes' contexts.
- **Spanish Language Model Installation**: Installed the `es_core_news_sm` Spanish language model for spaCy to facilitate [[NLP]] tasks in Spanish.

### Achievements:
- Successfully exported word counts to [[CSV]] and processed text for analysis.
- Gained insights into [[NLP]] techniques applicable to semantic analysis.
- Prepared necessary text files and scripts for detailed analysis of 'docentes'.

### Pending Tasks:
- Implement the POS tagging [[strategy]] using spaCy on the 'docentes' contexts.
- Conduct detailed semantic analysis using the installed Spanish language model in spaCy.
