**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI, Jupyter, Python, Openai, Automation, Data Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing Jupyter notebooks using [[AI]], focusing on enhancing data analysis projects through structured methodologies.

### Key Activities:
- **Notebook Processing Framework:** Outlined a structured approach for analyzing and processing notebooks, emphasizing objectives, methodologies, findings, code quality, and reorganization.
- **Prompt Structure and Strategies:** Designed prompts for Jupyter notebook analysis to improve [[AI]] response clarity and comprehensiveness, and explored strategies for applying prompts efficiently.
- **[[Workflow]] [[Development]]:** Created a detailed workflow for automating the analysis of notebooks using the OpenAI [[API]], including content extraction and response analysis.
- **[[Python]] Scripting:** Developed scripts using `nbformat` for content extraction and modifying scripts to access local variables within functions.
- **[[API]] [[Integration]]:** Guided the integration and execution of [[Python]] scripts with the OpenAI [[API]] locally, addressing errors and upgrading to the new OpenAI SDK.
- **[[Data Analysis]] Exercises:** Formulated strategies for transforming notebook comments into educational exercises and leveraging markdown analyses for project enhancement.

### Achievements:
- Established a robust framework and workflow for Jupyter notebook analysis using [[AI]] and automation tools.
- Developed [[Python]] scripts for content extraction and [[API]] interaction.
- Addressed [[API]] errors and upgraded to the latest OpenAI SDK.

### Pending Tasks:
- Implement the developed framework in a live project to validate its effectiveness.
- Further refine educational strategies and exercise designs based on real-world application.
