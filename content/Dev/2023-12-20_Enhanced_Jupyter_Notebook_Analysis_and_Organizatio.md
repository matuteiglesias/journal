### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance prompts for technical analysis of Jupyter notebooks and provide structured guidance for their organization by theme, difficulty, and data pipeline stages.

### Key Activities
- Developed modifications to prompts for obtaining detailed technical responses when analyzing Jupyter notebooks, focusing on clarity, examples, and code analysis.
- Created a structured prompt for reorganizing Jupyter notebooks by theme and difficulty, including thematic categorization and difficulty leveling.
- Provided guidance on adjusting the `max_tokens` parameter in the OpenAI [[API]] to optimize response length.
- Outlined steps to check OpenAI account balance and spending through the dashboard.
- Designed a prompt for organizing Jupyter notebooks by data pipeline stages and thematic areas, suggesting methods for creating an organized collection.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced prompts for technical analysis of Jupyter notebooks.
- Developed comprehensive guides for notebook organization by theme, difficulty, and data pipeline.
- Clarified the use of `max_tokens` in the OpenAI [[API]].
- Provided clear instructions for managing OpenAI account billing and usage.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the developed prompts in real-world Jupyter notebook analysis and organization tasks to evaluate their effectiveness.
