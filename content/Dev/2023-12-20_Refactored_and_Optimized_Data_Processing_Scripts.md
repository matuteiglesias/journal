### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the efficiency and maintainability of [[data processing]] scripts and Jupyter notebooks used in economic network analysis.

### Key Activities
- Revised a prompt for Jupyter Notebook analysis focusing on code functionality and integration.
- Proposed a restructuring plan for economic network analysis notebooks to improve modularity and coherence.
- Refactored [[Python]] code for [[data processing]] using Dask and [[Pandas]], improving readability and maintainability.
- Streamlined degree distribution plots notebook using [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]] for clarity and efficiency.
- Debugged and corrected [[Python]] code for plotting degree distributions, addressing runtime warnings and errors.
- Improved the structure of a data preparation script for better modularization and organization.
- Explored efficient line counting techniques in [[Python]] and Bash for large file processing.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored and optimized multiple [[data processing]] scripts and notebooks.
- Enhanced code readability, maintainability, and efficiency across several projects.
- Resolved issues in [[data visualization]] scripts, ensuring proper functionality.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the refactored scripts and notebooks are required to ensure robustness in different scenarios.
- Additional [[documentation]] and comments may be needed for some of the newly structured scripts.
