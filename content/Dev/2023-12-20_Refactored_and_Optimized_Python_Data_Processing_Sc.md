## üìÖ 2023-12-20 ‚Äî Session: Refactored and Optimized Python Data Processing Scripts

**üïí 18:00‚Äì21:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Dask, Data Processing, Optimization, Code Refactoring  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to refactor and optimize [[Python]] scripts for [[data processing]], focusing on enhancing readability, modularity, and performance using Dask and [[Pandas]].

**Key Activities:**
- Refactored [[Python]] code to improve readability and modularity by breaking down scripts into smaller functions.
- Simplified [[data processing]] scripts by consolidating functionalities and using Dask for handling large datasets.
- Developed scripts for processing ID, VAT degrees, and firm sizes, incorporating Dask for efficient data handling.
- Addressed errors in Dask DataFrame operations and optimized [[data processing]] pipelines with [[Pandas]] and Dask.
- Conducted experiments to determine optimal block sizes for Dask computations and configured Dask settings for specific hardware.
- Resolved compatibility issues between Dask and Bokeh, ensuring smooth operation of the Dask dashboard.

**Achievements:**
- Enhanced code readability and maintainability through refactoring.
- Improved [[data processing]] efficiency by optimizing Dask configurations and utilizing parallel processing techniques.
- Successfully resolved Dask and Bokeh compatibility issues, enabling effective use of the Dask dashboard.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refine Dask configurations for specific hardware setups to maximize performance.
- Explore additional [[optimization]] strategies for Dask workflows, particularly in column renaming and data pipeline execution.
