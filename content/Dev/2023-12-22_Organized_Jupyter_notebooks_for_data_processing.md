## 📅 2023-12-22 — Session: Organized Jupyter notebooks for data processing

**🕒 14:45–15:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Jupyter Notebooks, Data Processing, Data Analysis, Visualization, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to establish a structured approach for organizing Jupyter notebooks, focusing on data processing, analysis, and visualization.

### Key Activities:
- Developed templates for organizing Jupyter notebooks, emphasizing clarity and modularity in data processing and visualization.
- Provided detailed instructions for creating structured notebooks using [[Python]] libraries such as Dask, [[Pandas]], [[Matplotlib]], and Seaborn.
- Created specific notebook structures for tasks like analyzing degree distributions and performing advanced data analysis, including assortativity and quantile plots.

### Achievements:
- Successfully outlined structured templates for various data analysis tasks, enhancing the organization and readability of Jupyter notebooks.
- Defined a function to calculate the assortativity coefficient using NetworkX, integrating it into the notebook structure for network analysis.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further refinement of notebook templates to incorporate additional best practices and optimization techniques.
