## 📅 2023-12-22 — Session: Resolved Python Parquet File Handling Errors

**🕒 21:05–21:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Dask, Parquet, Data Processing, CSV  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to resolve runtime errors related to Parquet file handling in [[Python]] environments and to explore various methods for saving Dask DataFrames as [[CSV]] files.

### Key Activities
- **Resolving RuntimeError**: Addressed the `RuntimeError: Please install either pyarrow or fastparquet` by providing installation instructions for these libraries.
- **Saving Dask DataFrames**: Explored different methods to save Dask DataFrames to [[CSV]] files, including converting to [[Pandas]], using Dask's `to_csv` with a glob pattern, and employing the `single_file` parameter.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the Parquet file handling error by identifying and installing the necessary libraries.
- Clarified the process of saving Dask DataFrames to [[CSV]], offering multiple approaches for different use cases.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of Dask's capabilities in handling large datasets efficiently.
- Consider automating the installation of required libraries in [[Python]] environments to streamline [[data processing]] workflows.
