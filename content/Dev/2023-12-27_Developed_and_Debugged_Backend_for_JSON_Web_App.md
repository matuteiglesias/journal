## 📅 2023-12-27 — Session: Developed and Debugged Backend for JSON Web App

**🕒 22:50–23:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Backend, Error Handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:** To develop and debug the backend of a [[JSON]]-based web application using Node.js and Express.

**Key Activities:**
- Set up a web server and created [[API]] endpoints using Node.js and Express.
- Implemented search logic and response handling for client requests.
- Resolved a Node.js error related to the `server.js` file not being found by verifying the file's existence and location.
- Addressed the 'Cannot GET /' error in Express by defining a root endpoint and serving an HTML file.
- Connected the frontend with the backend for an MVP using AJAX requests to update the UI with search results.
- Implemented dropdown lists and search result areas in HTML using [[JavaScript]].
- Corrected discrepancies between HTML element IDs and [[JavaScript]] references to ensure proper display of search results.
- Resolved `Uncaught TypeError` in [[JavaScript]] by ensuring scripts execute after the DOM is fully loaded.
- Verified server and endpoint functionality in Node.js using Express, including [[debugging]] and testing with Postman.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully set up and debugged the backend for the web application, resolving multiple errors and ensuring smooth integration between frontend and backend components.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing of [[API]] endpoints for edge cases and performance [[optimization]].
- Implement additional features for enhanced user interaction and data handling.
