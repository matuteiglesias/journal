## 📅 2023-12-27 — Session: Resolved Common Node.js and JavaScript Errors

**🕒 23:40–00:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Node.js, JavaScript, Error Handling, Web Development  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to address and resolve common errors encountered in Node.js and [[JavaScript]] development environments.

**Key Activities:**
- **Node.js Error Resolution:** Addressed the `EADDRINUSE` error by freeing up port 3000, verifying port status, and restarting the server. Also resolved a `ReferenceError` by ensuring the variable 'resultados' was defined within the correct scope.
- **[[JavaScript]] and DOM Errors:** Solved issues related to the DOM, including the `document.getElementById(...) is null` error, by recommending the relocation of the `<script>` tag to the end of the HTML body to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before script execution.
- **Best Practices:** Emphasized the importance of script placement in HTML for proper execution and addressed [[JSON]] parsing errors and 404 XHR requests.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully resolved multiple errors in Node.js and [[JavaScript]], improving the stability and reliability of web applications.
- Implemented best practices for script placement in HTML to prevent common DOM-related errors.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further review and testing of the implemented solutions to ensure robustness across different environments and scenarios.
