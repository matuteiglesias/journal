**üïí 05:30‚Äì06:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Text Processing, Legal Articles, Algorithm Development  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine [[Python]] algorithms for extracting and processing legal articles from text documents.

### Key Activities
- **Algorithm Development**: Created and enhanced [[Python]] algorithms to parse and extract legal articles, focusing on handling context variations and numerical sequencing using regular expressions.
- **Word Count Implementation**: Developed a function to count words in legal articles, ensuring the text is fully accessible.
- **Article Grouping**: Implemented an algorithm to group articles into sections of up to 2500 words, modifying extraction and word count functions accordingly.
- **Distinguishing Articles from Citations**: Developed strategies to differentiate between articles and citations in legal documents using sequence analysis and context evaluation.
- **[[Troubleshooting]]**: Addressed text truncation issues and network connection errors, providing insights and solutions for `NewConnectionError` and `MaxRetryError`.
- **Code Updates**: Made several updates to handle article numbering and missing articles, ensuring continuous extraction beyond article 177.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed robust algorithms for extracting, grouping, and analyzing legal articles in [[Python]].
- Enhanced [[error handling]] and troubleshooting for network and extraction issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize algorithms for edge cases in article extraction and grouping.
- Implement automated testing for the developed functions to ensure reliability.
