## üìÖ 2023-12-28 ‚Äî Session: Developed Scripts for OpenAI API and Token Management

**üïí 15:05‚Äì15:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Openai Api, Python Scripting, Token Management, Legislative Analysis  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine scripts for processing data using the OpenAI [[API]], focusing on [[Jupyter]] notebooks and legislative texts, while managing token limits effectively.

### Key Activities
- **Script Development**: Created a script for processing [[Jupyter]] notebooks with the OpenAI [[API]], addressing notebook selection, prompt generation, [[API]] calls, error handling, and testing.
- **Legislative Text Processing**: Developed a [[Python]] script to process legislative texts using the OpenAI [[API]], including dynamic prompt integration for consistent output.
- **Token Management**: Explored methods for calculating and managing token usage in [[API]] requests, including strategies for handling long text segments and understanding token limits.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed scripts for both [[Jupyter]] notebook processing and legislative text analysis.
- Implemented dynamic prompt integration and error handling in scripts.
- Gained insights into token calculation and management, ensuring compliance with [[API]] limits.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of scripts for efficiency and accuracy.
- Explore additional strategies for managing token limits in complex [[API]] requests.
