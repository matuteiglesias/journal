## üìÖ 2024-01-15 ‚Äî Session: Developed Stock Data Processing and Visualization Workflow

**üïí 18:30‚Äì19:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Stock Analysis, Data Processing, Visualization, Python, Matplotlib  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive [[workflow]] for processing and visualizing stock data using [[Python]], [[Pandas]], and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities:
- **Manual Plotting with [[Matplotlib]]:** Implemented manual plotting techniques to address x-axis date formatting issues, enhancing control over [[data visualization]].
- **Workflow Planning:** Outlined a [[workflow]] for analyzing stock data, including the creation of functions for [[data processing]] and plotting.
- **Function Implementation:** Developed functions for processing stock data, including date parsing and setting them as an index, and for plotting multiple data columns over time.
- **Business Case Atlas Creation:** Processed stock data to create an 'atlas' of past business cases, involving sampling, sorting, and visualization in Markdown format.
- **Data Conversion:** Converted Excel-style date integers to [[Pandas]] Timestamps using `pandas.to_datetime()` within a [[data processing]] loop.

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented a [[workflow]] for stock [[data analysis]] and visualization.
- Developed reusable functions for [[data processing]] and plotting.
- Enhanced [[data visualization]] techniques with manual date formatting control.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further refine the [[data processing]] functions to accommodate various data structures and analysis objectives.
- Explore additional visualization techniques to improve data representation.
