**🕒 20:50–21:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: yfinance, stock data, Python, DataFrame, financial analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to download, process, and analyze stock data using [[Python]]'s `yfinance` library.

### Key Activities
- **Downloading Stock Data**: Utilized the `yfinance` library to download the last 60 days of stock data for a list of tickers. The script included [[error handling]] and data concatenation.
- **Data Concatenation**: Combined stock data into a single DataFrame, ensuring robust [[error handling]] for any missing data points.
- **Fetching and Comparing Prices**: Retrieved current stock prices and compared them with historical prices from two months ago, leveraging `yfinance`.
- **Ranking Stock Prices**: Implemented a method to rank closing prices within each ticker group using pandas' `groupby` and `rank` functions.

### Achievements
- Successfully downloaded and processed stock data, creating a comprehensive DataFrame for analysis.
- Implemented a robust [[error handling]] mechanism to manage missing data.
- Developed a method to rank stock prices effectively within the dataset.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of ranked stock data to identify trends or insights.
- [[Integration]] of additional financial metrics for a more comprehensive analysis.
