**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Backtrader, Debugging, Data Processing, Trading Strategy, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug and enhance a trading strategy using Backtrader, focusing on the `OLSResiduals` indicator and data fetching methods.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] OLSResiduals Indicator**: Addressed an issue with an unpopulated `prices` array in the `next` method by checking data feed loading and refining data fetching methods.
- **Improving Data Fetching**: Implemented robust data fetching techniques, including direct data slicing for price fetching and ensuring valid log prices calculations.
- **Handling Data Feed Issues**: Explored solutions for empty data feeds in the `ResidualsStrategy` class, emphasizing data loading timing and method usage.
- **Adjusting Historical Data Access**: Modified the Backtrader code to use the `get` method for historical data access and adjusted the `next` method for the `OLSResiduals` indicator.
- **[[Error Handling]] in Price [[Data Processing]]**: Calculated OLS residuals from price data, handling non-positive values and ensuring error management during logarithm calculations.
- **Manual Construction of Prices Array**: Constructed a prices array from historical close prices in the strategy, ensuring proper error handling.
- **Advanced Plotting Techniques**: Implemented advanced plotting techniques in Backtrader, including plotting multiple data feeds and customizing observers.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged the `OLSResiduals` indicator and improved data fetching methods.
- Enhanced error handling in price data processing.
- Developed advanced plotting capabilities for Backtrader simulations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated trading strategy to ensure robustness.
- [[Integration]] of additional financial data sources for comprehensive analysis.
