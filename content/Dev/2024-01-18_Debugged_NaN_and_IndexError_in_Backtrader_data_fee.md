## 📅 2024-01-18 — Session: Debugged NaN and IndexError in Backtrader data feed

**🕒 17:50–19:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Backtrader, Debugging, Python, Data Processing, Residuals  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to NaN values and IndexErrors in residuals data when using Backtrader with PandasData.

### Key Activities
- **Data Alignment and [[Debugging]]**: Steps were outlined to inspect and correct data alignment issues causing NaN values in residuals. This involved enhancing debug prints and checking data feed structures.
- **Custom [[CSV]] Data Feed Creation**: Developed a custom [[CSV]] data feed by inheriting from `backtrader.CSVDataBase` to handle residuals data effectively.
- **Error Diagnosis and Correction**: Addressed 'IndexError: list index out of range' and `ValueError` during datetime conversion by adding debugging information and enhancing error handling.
- **Namespace Conflict Resolution**: Resolved a namespace conflict in [[Python]] imports related to the `datetime` module and Backtrader.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and resolved NaN and IndexError issues in Backtrader data feeds.
- Implemented a custom [[CSV]] data feed for residuals, enhancing data handling and integration.
- Improved error handling and debugging techniques for better data processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the custom [[CSV]] data feed with different datasets to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring for any additional errors or edge cases that might arise in different trading scenarios.
