## üìÖ 2024-01-18 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced OLS Residuals Calculation and Visualization

**üïí 16:05‚Äì17:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, OLS, Data Visualization, Rolling Residuals, Finance  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the calculation and visualization of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) residuals for financial [[data analysis]].

### Key Activities
- **Modified Function for Rolling Residuals Calculation**: Updated the `add_rolling_residuals` function to perform OLS computations directly within the function, allowing for better [[debugging]] and control.
- **Line Plot Creation**: Developed a line plot of adjusted close prices with residuals, due to the unavailability of `mplfinance` for candlestick charts.
- **Diagnostic Plot for OLS Model**: Outlined the steps to create a diagnostic plot for an OLS model, including regression line, residuals, and model parameter annotations.
- **[[Integration]] with Candlestick Chart**: Provided a script to integrate OLS diagnostic plots with candlestick charts, enhancing stock [[data visualization]].
- **Efficient Calculation for Multiple Tickers**: Implemented a script to apply the rolling residuals function across multiple tickers and save the results to a [[CSV]] file.

### Achievements
- Successfully modified and tested the `add_rolling_residuals` function.
- Created visualizations that integrate OLS diagnostics with stock data, improving analytical insights.

### Pending Tasks
- Explore alternatives or updates for `mplfinance` to support candlestick charting directly.
- Further optimize the rolling residuals calculation for large datasets.
