## 📅 2024-01-18 — Session: Resolved Data Loading Issues in Backtrader

**🕒 21:15–21:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Backtrader, Data Loading, Python, Error Handling, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The primary goal of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve data loading issues in the Backtrader framework, specifically focusing on the `ResidualsCSVData` class.

### Key Activities:
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Data Loading:** Identified issues with the `ResidualsCSVData` class where data lengths were reported as zero. Verified the [[CSV]] format to ensure correct data loading.
- **[[Debugging]] Data Feed Length:** Revised strategies to directly access data points in Backtrader, ensuring accurate data handling.
- **Modifying Class for Time Series:** Modified the `ResidualsCSVData` class to read entire [[CSV]] files for multiple tickers, enabling time series data extraction.
- **Fixing Initialization Errors:** Addressed TypeErrors during the initialization of the `ResidualsCSVData` class by correctly initializing the parent class with appropriate parameters.
- **Correcting Data Parameter Errors:** Solved issues with the `dataname` parameter being `None` by ensuring a [[Pandas]] DataFrame is correctly passed to the `PandasData` class.

### Achievements:
- Successfully resolved data loading and initialization errors in the `ResidualsCSVData` and `PandasData` classes.
- Improved the data handling strategy in Backtrader, allowing for more robust time series data processing.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing is required to validate the changes across different datasets and scenarios in Backtrader to ensure robustness.
