### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop, test, and deploy a [[Flask]] application with integrated Google OAuth for user authentication.

### Key Activities
- **Testing Application for Exercise Loading and Display:** A comprehensive checklist was used for both manual and automated testing of the application to ensure exercises are correctly loaded and displayed.
- **Running and Testing a [[Flask]] Application Locally:** Instructions were followed to start a [[Flask]] application locally, set environment variables, and access specific routes.
- **Configuring [[Flask]] [[Development]] in VS Code:** The session included running a [[Flask]] application in VS Code, focusing on the OAuth2 flow and implementing a sample `User` model using SQLAlchemy.
- **Adjusting [[Flask]] Application for [[CSV]] and [[JSON]] [[Data Management]]:** Modifications were made to handle exercises using [[CSV]] files and record user interactions in [[JSON]] format.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] [[Flask]]-Session Import Error:** Common causes and solutions for import errors related to `flask_session` were addressed.
- **Resolving [[Flask]] TemplateNotFound Error:** Steps were taken to resolve the `TemplateNotFound: login.html` error by ensuring correct directory structure and file naming.
- **Integrating Google OAuth in [[Flask]] Applications:** A step-by-step guide was followed to integrate Google OAuth for user authentication, including setup and implementation.
- **Setting Up Google OAuth for [[Flask]] Applications:** Steps were outlined to create a Web application client ID for Google OAuth integration.
- **Hosting [[Flask]] Applications on [[Google Cloud]] Platform:** Options for hosting on [[Google Cloud]] Platform were explored, including App Engine and Compute Engine.
- **Hosting [[Flask]] Applications on Google App Engine:** The advantages and steps for hosting on Google App Engine were reviewed.

### Achievements
- Successfully tested and ran a [[Flask]] application locally with integrated Google OAuth.
- Resolved common errors related to [[Flask]]-Session and template handling.
- Configured the application for data management using [[CSV]] and [[JSON]].
- Explored hosting options on [[Google Cloud]] Platform.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize deployment on [[Google Cloud]] Platform.
- Conduct further testing for edge cases in OAuth integration.
- Optimize application performance for cloud hosting.
