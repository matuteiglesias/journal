### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a dynamic [[HTML]] template for an educational platform, enabling the integration of exercises from a [[CSV]] file into various sections of the platform using JavaScript and [[Flask]].

### Key Activities
- Created an [[HTML]] template with dynamic sections for exercises based on programming paradigms.
- Implemented JavaScript code to dynamically populate the 'Extras' section from a [[CSV]] data source.
- Developed a method to load exercises from a [[CSV]] file into a web page using JavaScript.
- Integrated [[CSV]] data into [[HTML]] using AJAX calls to a [[Flask]] backend, including setting up a [[Flask]] route to serve [[CSV]] data as [[JSON]].
- Troubleshooted a `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` in the [[Flask]] endpoint `/get_exercises`, addressing [[CSV]] file path issues and error handling.
- Resolved issues with Google Sign-In configuration and AJAX data loading.
- Addressed [[JSON]] parsing errors in [[Flask]] endpoints and client-side JavaScript, ensuring proper [[JSON]] formatting and parsing.
- Debugged a JavaScript error `TypeError: table is null` by verifying DOM element existence and script placement.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a dynamic [[HTML]] template for the educational platform.
- Established a working method to integrate [[CSV]] data dynamically into the platform using [[Flask]] and AJAX.
- Resolved multiple technical issues, including server errors and JavaScript errors, enhancing the robustness of the application.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the dynamic content loading process.
- [[Optimization]] of error handling mechanisms in both server-side and client-side code.
