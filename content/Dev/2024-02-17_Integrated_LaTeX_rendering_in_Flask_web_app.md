**üïí 17:20‚Äì18:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flask, Latex, Mathjax, Web Development, Education  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to integrate dynamic LaTeX rendering into a [[Flask]]-based web application using MathJax, enhancing the educational platform's capability to display mathematical exercises.

### Key Activities
1. **Dynamic Exercise Display**: Implemented a workflow to dynamically display exercises using [[Flask]], incorporating LaTeX rendering with MathJax or KaTeX.
2. **[[Flask]] Route Adjustments**: Updated links in `index.html` to correctly point to [[Flask]] routes serving exercise content, ensuring proper rendering in `exercise.html`.
3. **LaTeX [[Integration]]**: Integrated LaTeX-rendered exercises into the platform using MathJax, with necessary [[HTML]] and [[Python]] code adjustments.
4. **Content Handling**: Developed a function to fetch exercise content from text files for MathJax processing.
5. **[[Troubleshooting]]**: Addressed MathJax errors related to unsupported LaTeX environments by modifying content and extending configurations.
6. **Rendering Issues**: Resolved LaTeX rendering issues by focusing on unsupported environments and dynamic embedding in [[HTML]] templates.
7. **Inline LaTeX Rendering**: Configured MathJax to render inline LaTeX expressions in [[HTML]], setting up delimiters and preprocessing content.
8. **CDN [[Integration]]**: Integrated MathJax via CDN, configuring options for both MathJax version 2 and 3.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated MathJax for dynamic LaTeX rendering in the [[Flask]] application.
- Improved the educational platform's capability to render complex mathematical content.
- Resolved rendering issues and optimized configurations for better performance.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of LaTeX rendering configurations.
- Explore additional MathJax features for enhanced rendering capabilities.
