### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to enhance logging practices and debug issues in [[Flask]] applications deployed on [[Google Cloud]] Platform, with a focus on improving performance and reliability.

### Key Activities
- **Differentiated Backtracking and Recursive Call Trees**: Explored the distinct purposes and applications of these data structures in algorithm [[optimization]].
- **App Authorization Guidelines**: Reviewed instructions for completing app authorization forms, emphasizing clarity and security.
- **[[Debugging]] Worker Timeouts**: Analyzed application logs to identify causes of worker timeouts in the `/submit_answer` endpoint, suggesting potential solutions.
- **[[Flask]] Logging Implementation**: Detailed how to implement [[Python]]'s logging module in [[Flask]] applications, integrating with GCP for enhanced log management.
- **Diagnosing [[Flask]] Errors**: Investigated `UnboundLocalError` and `KeyError: 'ENV'` in [[Flask]], providing troubleshooting steps and solutions.
- **Gunicorn Configuration**: Provided instructions for configuring Gunicorn on Google App Engine, including timeout adjustments and environment setup.
- **Best Practices for Sensitive Information**: Emphasized caution in handling sensitive information in code sharing.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined best practices for logging configuration in [[Flask]] applications.
- Identified and provided solutions for common errors in [[Flask]] applications.
- Enhanced understanding of logging integration with [[Google Cloud]] Platform.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore the impact of logging configurations on application performance.
- Implement the suggested logging enhancements in a production environment.
- Monitor the changes for any unforeseen issues or improvements.
