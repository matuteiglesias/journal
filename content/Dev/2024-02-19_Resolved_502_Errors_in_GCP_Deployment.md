### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve 502 Bad Gateway errors occurring during a [[Google Cloud]] Platform (GCP) application deployment using [[Flask]] and Gunicorn.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] 502 Errors**: Addressed issues related to dependency management, Gunicorn configuration, filesystem permissions, session management, environment variables, and compatibility.
- **Read-Only File System Management**: Implemented solutions for handling read-only file systems in Google App Engine, focusing on session management and data storage.
- **Function Adaptation**: Adapted the `record_interaction` function for GCP, utilizing the `/tmp` directory for temporary storage and exploring permanent alternatives.
- **Module and File Handling**: Managed [[Python]] modules and file writing solutions to avoid read-only filesystem issues, ensuring proper module versions and directory permissions.
- **Dependency Management**: Updated `requirements.txt` with specific versions to ensure compatibility and prevent deployment issues.
- **Login Redirection Analysis**: Analyzed and resolved login redirection issues due to invalid URLs in the application.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and resolved causes of 502 errors related to missing dependencies and file system issues.
- Implemented a writable directory solution for file handling in GCP.
- Updated `requirements.txt` for compatibility with the `base2` environment.
- Resolved login redirection issues and improved OAuth redirect handling in [[Flask]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated `requirements.txt` for compatibility before full deployment.
- Continuous monitoring of the application for any recurring 502 errors or login issues.
