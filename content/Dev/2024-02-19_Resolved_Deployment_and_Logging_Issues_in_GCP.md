**üïí 17:55‚Äì19:15**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Google Cloud, App Engine, Deployment, Logging, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve deployment and logging issues encountered in [[Google Cloud]] Platform (GCP) applications, particularly those using Google App Engine and [[Flask]].

### Key Activities
- **[[Deployment]] Error Resolution**: Addressed deployment errors in Google App Engine by reviewing project configurations, quotas, and logs.
- **Logging [[Integration]]**: Integrated [[Google Cloud]] Logging with [[Flask]], focusing on configuration issues related to the 'ENV' variable.
- **YAML Syntax Correction**: Resolved syntax errors in the app.yaml file for GCP deployments.
- **Entrypoint [[Configuration]]**: Troubleshot syntax errors in App Engine entrypoint configurations.
- **File System [[Error Handling]]**: Solved OSError related to read-only file systems by changing log file locations and using [[Google Cloud]] Logging.
- **File Handling Issues**: Reflected on common file handling and permissions issues in GCP's App Engine environment.
- **Logger Initialization**: Diagnosed and fixed `AttributeError` in [[Python]] logger initialization.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Planned and implemented object-oriented design for evaluators in [[Python]] applications.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple deployment and logging issues in GCP.
- Improved logging integration and error handling in [[Flask]] applications.
- Enhanced understanding of file handling and permissions in GCP.
- Developed a robust object-oriented design for evaluators in [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the implemented solutions in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Review and refine the object-oriented design for evaluators to accommodate future scalability.
