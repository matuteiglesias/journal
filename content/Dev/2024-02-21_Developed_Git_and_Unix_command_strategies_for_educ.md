**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the development and management processes for an educational platform by organizing team collaboration and improving code management practices using [[Git]] and Unix/Linux commands.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed a framework for team organization focusing on documentation, development strategy, code review, communication, training, external contributions, and evaluation for an educational platform.
- Provided detailed Unix/Linux command instructions for file deletion, including handling backup files and managing [[Git]] changes.
- Addressed [[Git]] errors, specifically resolving issues with `git rm`, and explained the use of `--cached` to manage file tracking without physical deletion.
- Offered a structured approach to commit strategies in [[Git]], detailing how to organize changes into specific commits and provided command examples.

**Achievements:**
- Established a comprehensive framework for team collaboration and platform improvement.
- Clarified Unix/Linux file management commands and [[Git]] troubleshooting techniques.
- Developed a clear strategy for commit management in [[Git]].

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of [[AI]] integration and user experience enhancements in the educational platform.
- Continued refinement of collaboration strategies and documentation practices.
