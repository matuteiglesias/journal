### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the feedback submission process by integrating AJAX to prevent page redirection, fix errors in the [[Flask]] application, and ensure proper data submission to Firestore.

### Key Activities
- Modified feedback submission behavior to prevent redirection and fixed a KeyError in the teacher time submission process.
- Integrated AJAX into the HTML feedback form using jQuery to enable seamless user experience without page reloads.
- Corrected URL endpoint mismatches in [[Flask]], ensuring proper routing and template existence.
- Diagnosed and resolved Firestore submission issues by checking permissions, validating data fields, and enhancing error handling.
- Troubleshot feedback submission issues in [[Flask]], focusing on form field names, AJAX, server-side logging, and Firestore operations.
- Debugged the `submit_feedback` function in Firestore, addressing method usage, form field mismatches, and logging practices.
- Adjusted the feedback form to include `exercise_id` as a hidden input field for accurate data submission.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated AJAX for feedback submission, improving user experience.
- Resolved [[Flask]] routing errors and ensured correct data submission to Firestore.
- Enhanced error handling and logging practices for better debugging and monitoring.

### Pending Tasks
- Conduct thorough integration testing to ensure all changes work seamlessly together.
- Review server-side logging to further enhance error detection and resolution.
