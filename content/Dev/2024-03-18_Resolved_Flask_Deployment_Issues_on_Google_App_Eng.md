### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve deployment issues encountered when deploying a [[Flask]] application on Google App Engine using Gunicorn.

### Key Activities
- Explored the use of `app.run()` in [[Flask]] for local development and configured deployment settings for Google App Engine.
- Addressed the 'Failed to find application object' error by verifying import paths, the application factory function, and environment configurations.
- Provided a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot deployment issues, with a focus on the `create_app()` function and Gunicorn configuration.
- Ensured correct specification of the application factory function in the Gunicorn entry point within the `app.yaml` file.
- Diagnosed deployment issues by checking configuration, logging, and potential solutions.
- Ensured `main.py` was correctly located in the application directory and configured logging in the [[Flask]] application.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and resolved configuration and deployment issues related to the [[Flask]] application on Google App Engine.
- Implemented logging to aid in future debugging efforts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the deployment in a production-like environment to ensure stability and performance.
- Monitor logs for any new issues that may arise during continued deployment efforts.
