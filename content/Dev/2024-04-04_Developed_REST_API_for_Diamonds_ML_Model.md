### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and optimize a REST [[API]] for a machine learning model predicting diamond prices, integrating various software development and cloud infrastructure practices.

### Key Activities
- **Mastered REST [[API]] Concepts:** Reviewed essential knowledge for creating REST APIs, focusing on integrating machine learning models.
- **Developed ML Model as REST [[API]]:** Executed stages of creating a REST [[API]] using the diamonds dataset, including data preparation, model training, and deployment.
- **Built GCP Infrastructure:** Planned a cloud-based infrastructure on [[Google Cloud]] Platform for model training and serving, emphasizing containerization and deployment.
- **Architectural Planning:** Considered scalable and robust system design for machine learning APIs.
- **Repository Evaluation:** Reflected on best practices for version control and evaluated a forked repository for development skills.
- **Repository Structure Planning:** Proposed a modular structure for the ML [[API]] project repository, focusing on future cloud integration.
- **Project Pitch:** Developed a project pitch for the Diamonds ML [[API]], outlining key components and integration plans.
- **Environment Setup:** Set up the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for [[API]] access.
- **Bash Command Handling:** Documented methods for handling Markdown characters in bash commands.
- **Software Structure Analysis:** Analyzed the software structure for the Diamonds1 project using ChatDev.
- **[[Optimization]] of `run.py` Parameters:** Optimized parameters in ChatDev's `run.py` for the Diamonds ML [[API]] project.
- **[[Flask]] Script Comparison:** Compared [[Flask]] scripts for serving diamond price predictions, identifying strengths and integration opportunities.

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined and initiated the development of a REST [[API]] for a machine learning model.
- Planned and partially executed the integration with GCP for scalable deployment.
- Established a clear project structure and environment setup for future development.

### Pending Tasks
- Complete the deployment of the REST [[API]] on GCP.
- Finalize the integration of [[Flask]] applications for a robust prediction service.
- Continue refining the repository structure and documentation.
- Further optimize the `run.py` script based on testing feedback.
