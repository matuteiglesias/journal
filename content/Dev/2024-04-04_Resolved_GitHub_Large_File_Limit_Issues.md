- Committed edited notebooks to a Git repository, ensuring deleted data files were not included.
- Resolved Git push errors caused by remote changes not present in the local repository through merging and rebasing.
- Staged deletions and new files before performing a rebase, resolving conflicts and pushing changes.
- Utilized a .gitignore file to exclude specific local files from Git tracking.

### Achievements
