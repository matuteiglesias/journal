### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a structured plan for creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a machine learning [[API]] that predicts diamond prices.

### Key Activities
- **Scope Definition**: Established the scope for the MVP, focusing on a 4-hour development session.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Outlined steps for preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training**: Discussed the use of Random Forest for model evaluation.
- **[[API]] Development**: Planned the [[API]] structure using [[Flask]].
- **Containerization**: Considered Docker for deployment.
- **Testing and [[Documentation]]**: Highlighted the importance of testing and documentation for the MVP.

### Achievements
- Created a comprehensive plan for a 4-hour sprint to develop a machine learning [[API]].
- Clarified project goals, technical specifications, and dataset characteristics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further details needed on project constraints, team roles, and risk management to tailor the guidance for the MVP session.
