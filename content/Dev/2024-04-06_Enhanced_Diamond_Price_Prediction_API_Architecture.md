## 📅 2024-04-06 — Session: Enhanced Diamond Price Prediction API Architecture

**🕒 16:50–17:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: API, Flask, Machine Learning, Software Architecture, Data Preprocessing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve the architecture of a diamond price prediction [[API]], focusing on modularization, maintainability, and scalability.

### Key Activities
- Designed an enhanced architecture for the [[API]] using [[Python]] and [[Flask]], emphasizing modularity and best practices.
- Provided a detailed overview of the `utils` directory for organizing reusable utility functions and classes.
- Implemented a `train_and_save_model` function for `RandomForestRegressor` with hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
- Improved preprocessing for the diamonds dataset, including outlier handling and feature engineering.
- Developed an end-to-end model testing script integrating data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- Fixed an AttributeError related to `OneHotEncoder` in scikit-learn, updating deprecated methods.
- Adjusted the `preprocess_data()` function to separate features and labels.

### Achievements
- Established a robust [[API]] architecture blueprint with a clear file structure.
- Enhanced model training with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics.
- Improved data preprocessing techniques for better model performance.
- Resolved issues with deprecated methods in scikit-learn, ensuring code compatibility.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the [[API]] architecture in a production environment.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of preprocessing strategies as needed.
