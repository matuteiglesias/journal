## 📅 2024-04-06 — Session: Enhancing Flask API with Git and Docker

**🕒 19:30–20:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Flask, Git, Docker, Web Development, API  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance a [[Flask]] application by addressing 404 errors, improving the welcome message, and integrating Git and Docker for better version control and deployment.

### Key Activities
- **Handling 404 Errors**: Implemented a root URL route to manage 404 Not Found errors in the [[Flask]] application.
- **Enhancing Welcome Message**: Explored methods to improve the [[Flask]] application's landing page using HTML and [[API]] [[documentation]].
- **Commit Message Structuring**: Provided guidelines for creating structured commit messages during [[API]] setup.
- **Git Version Control**: Discussed best practices for organizing Git commits, unstaging files, and understanding Git status outputs.
- **Viewing Git History**: Explained the use of `git log` for viewing commit history and managing branches.
- **Docker Containerization**: Offered a guide on using Docker to containerize the [[Flask]] [[API]], including Dockerfile examples.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a [[strategy]] for handling 404 errors in [[Flask]].
- Enhanced the user experience of the [[Flask]] application with a more informative welcome message.
- Established a clear structure for Git commit messages and version control practices.
- Containerized the [[Flask]] [[API]] using Docker, setting the stage for scalable deployment.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the Docker image to optimize performance.
- Explore the integration of cloud computing services for deployment, focusing on scalability and cost-effectiveness.
