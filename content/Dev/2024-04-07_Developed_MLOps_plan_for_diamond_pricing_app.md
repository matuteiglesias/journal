**🕒 15:50–16:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: MLOps, machine learning, diamond pricing, cloud infrastructure  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to develop a comprehensive plan for a diamond price prediction application, focusing on MLOps, [[Flask]] application enhancements, Docker [[optimization]], cloud infrastructure planning, and [[documentation]] best practices.

### Key Activities
- Outlined the agenda for developing the diamond price prediction application, covering MLOps, [[Flask]], Docker, and cloud technologies.
- Formulated guiding questions to direct the project planning, addressing objectives, data quality, model metrics, infrastructure, and budget.
- Provided an overview of the project, detailing objectives, current status, data sources, and security considerations.
- Developed a comprehensive MLOps [[strategy]], covering model development, deployment, monitoring, and re-training.
- Created a 10-day MLOps [[workflow]] plan focusing on setup, model training, deployment, and [[documentation]].
- Planned the integration of a new 'special' characteristic into the diamond dataset to enhance UI and model training.

### Achievements
- A detailed MLOps [[strategy]] and a structured 10-day [[workflow]] plan were established, setting a clear path for the project's execution.
- Addressed critical aspects of the project, including infrastructure, data management, and security.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the outlined MLOps [[strategy]] and 10-day [[workflow]] plan.
- Integrate the 'special' characteristic into the diamond dataset and update the model training processes accordingly.
