### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a machine learning model using the diamonds dataset and restructure the [[Git]] repository for better project management.

### Key Activities
- **Model Development Plan**: Outlined a structured plan for developing a machine learning model with sections on data preprocessing, incremental model training, evaluation, and production issues.
- **[[Git]] Repository Restructure**: Followed a step-by-step guide to organize and update the [[Git]] repository, including adding and removing files, and managing commits and pushes.
- **[[Git]] Error Resolution**: Troubleshot and resolved the [[Git]] error 'fatal: couldn't find remote ref localdev' by checking remote branches and handling merge conflicts.
- **Branch [[Integration]]**: Integrated the local [[Git]] branch with remote repositories using options for pushing, merging, or rebasing changes.
- **Commit History Viewing**: Used `git log` to view and customize commit logs.
- **Model Training Code Revision**: Revised code for model training using SGDRegressor, including data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **FileNotFoundError Resolution**: Resolved a `FileNotFoundError` in [[Python]] by understanding file paths and checking the current working directory.
- **Project Directory Setup**: Set a default project directory in [[Python]] scripts using the `os` module.
- **Grid Search Setup and Analysis**: Set up GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of SGDRegressor and analyzed results to draw insights on model performance.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a comprehensive plan for the machine learning model.
- Restructured the [[Git]] repository for improved version control and project management.
- Resolved multiple [[Git]] errors and integrated branches effectively.
- Revised model training code and set up hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of grid search results to optimize model performance.
- Continuous monitoring and management of the [[Git]] repository for future changes.
