**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance a web-based application for predicting diamond prices using machine learning, focusing on improving model retraining, visualization, and [[API]] integration.

**Key Activities:**
- Organized [[Git]] commits to ensure clarity and maintainability, emphasizing best practices in version control.
- Provided a technical overview of the diamond price prediction application, detailing its architecture and technologies such as [[Flask]], [[Pandas]], and Scikit-Learn.
- Prepared for development by reviewing current implementations and enhancing UI features, testing, and documentation.
- Implemented strategies for optimizing dynamic model retraining and visualization, focusing on data management and real-time updates.
- Created a JavaScript function `fetchModels` and a corresponding [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint for fetching and serving plotting data.
- Developed a [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint to serve actual vs. predicted price data and a JavaScript function for dynamic data visualization.
- Updated the `get_latest_model_predictions` function for dynamic loading and error handling in [[Flask]].
- Resolved a JavaScript error related to DOM manipulation by ensuring proper element existence and script loading order.
- Fixed the `/api/plot-data` endpoint in the [[Flask]] application to include a `model_name` parameter for fetching model predictions.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented and integrated dynamic model retraining and visualization features.
- Enhanced the application's architecture and functionality through improved [[API]] and frontend-backend integration.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced features to ensure robustness and reliability.
