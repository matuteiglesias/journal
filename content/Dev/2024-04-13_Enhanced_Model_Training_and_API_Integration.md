**üïí 00:05‚Äì23:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Machine Learning, Api Integration, Preprocessing, Model Retraining, Data Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the model training pipeline, improve [[API]] integration, and address preprocessing challenges in machine learning workflows.

### Key Activities
- **Model Saving and Naming Conventions**: Discussed best practices for naming conventions to ensure clarity and organization when saving models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Developed a pipeline for model training using `SGDRegressor`, including steps for evaluation and model saving.
- **Data Handling Enhancements**: Implemented methods for saving predictions to [[CSV]] for better data accessibility.
- **[[API]] [[Integration]]**: Enhanced the `retrainModel` and `updatePlots` functions in a web application, focusing on backend communication and frontend updates.
- **[[Troubleshooting]]**: Resolved issues related to undefined model names in [[API]] calls, float conversion errors, and handling unknown categories in data transformation.
- **Preprocessing [[Pipeline]]**: Integrated preprocessing steps in model predictions and addressed challenges with `OneHotEncoder` and `ColumnTransformer` pipelines.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a comprehensive model training and evaluation pipeline.
- Improved [[API]] integration with enhanced backend and frontend communication.
- Resolved multiple data preprocessing and [[API]]-related issues, ensuring smoother operation of the machine learning workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the preprocessing pipeline to handle more complex data scenarios.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model retraining endpoint to incorporate new data and preprocessing steps.
