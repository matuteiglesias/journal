### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve 404 errors in a [[Flask]] [[API]], improve [[Python]] package structure for better imports, and enhance HTML form handling for web applications.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing 404 Errors in [[Flask]] [[API]] Routes:** Followed a comprehensive guide to ensure proper route setup, data handling, and JavaScript integration to resolve 404 errors in a [[Flask]] application.
- **Importing Functions in [[Flask]] Applications:** Addressed issues related to importing functions by emphasizing proper structuring and import practices.
- **Setting Up [[Python]] Package Structure:** Outlined steps to structure a [[Python]] project by ensuring all functions in `.py` files within the `src` directory are accessible.
- **Setting Up [[Python]] Project as a Package:** Converted a [[Python]] project into a package by adding `__init__.py` files and configuring the [[Python]] path.
- **Resolving [[Flask]] Application Path Issues:** Diagnosed and corrected file path issues in a [[Flask]] application for loading model files using absolute and relative paths.
- **Resolving Missing Features in Model Input:** Provided solutions for addressing KeyErrors caused by missing features in model input, including form and JavaScript updates.
- **Setting Default Values in HTML Forms:** Enhanced user experience by setting default values in HTML forms for diamond attributes.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved 404 errors in [[Flask]] routes.
- Improved project structure for better function imports.
- Enhanced form handling and user experience in web applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[Flask]] application to ensure all routes and imports are functioning correctly.
- Review and optimize the HTML form validation and default settings for various user scenarios.
