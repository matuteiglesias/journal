**üïí 15:45‚Äì17:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: MLflow, Docker, Flask, MLOps, Experiment Tracking  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to integrate MLflow with Docker and [[Flask]] applications to enhance MLOps capabilities, focusing on experiment tracking, model versioning, and artifact management.

### Key Activities:
- Explored MLOps tools like MLflow, DVC, and Kubeflow for managing model and data versioning.
- Created a [[workflow]] diagram using Graphviz to illustrate MLflow and DVC integration.
- Configured MLflow's tracking URI for local and remote setups.
- Set up MLflow in a Docker container, modifying the Dockerfile and application settings for experiment tracking.
- Enhanced a [[Flask]] endpoint with MLflow for improved model retraining and experiment tracking.
- Resolved MLflow-related permission errors and tracking URI path issues.
- Implemented a naming convention for MLflow experiments to ensure meaningful and unique identifiers.
- Addressed file path discrepancies in [[Python]] for model saving/loading.
- Adjusted model loading in [[Flask]] applications to use standardized temporary directories.
- Updated model retrieval and dropdown selection in APIs to ensure accessibility of models.

### Achievements:
- Successfully configured MLflow with Docker and [[Flask]], resolving several configuration and permission issues.
- Developed a robust [[workflow]] for experiment tracking and model management in MLOps.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the integrated system in a production-like environment to ensure stability and performance.
- Continuous monitoring and [[optimization]] of the MLflow setup as new requirements arise.
