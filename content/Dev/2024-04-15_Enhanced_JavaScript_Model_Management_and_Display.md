## 📅 2024-04-15 — Session: Enhanced JavaScript Model Management and Display

**🕒 20:35–21:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Javascript, Web Development, API, Model Management, Graphviz  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session focused on enhancing the JavaScript code for managing and displaying model information, ensuring efficient data retrieval and display without duplication.

**Key Activities:**
- Modified the `fetchModelInfo` function to append rows to an existing table, preventing replacement and ensuring all models are displayed.
- Aggregated model information from [[API]] endpoints `/api/models` and `/api/get-model-info` to display a comprehensive list of trained models with versions and metrics.
- Developed pseudo-code for initializing and populating a model info table with server-fetched data.
- Refined JavaScript code in `app.js` for model prediction, retraining, and fetching model information, ensuring HTML element compatibility and MLflow server operation.
- Implemented strategies to prevent table row duplication and manage state in JavaScript applications using local storage and server sessions.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully updated the JavaScript functions to handle model information more robustly, preventing duplicate entries and ensuring efficient data display.
- Created a Graphviz DOT representation of the ML workflow, detailing component interactions.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further debugging of duplicate entries in the `fetchModelInfo` function when called from [[API]] endpoints.
- Explore additional state management strategies for enhanced application resilience.
