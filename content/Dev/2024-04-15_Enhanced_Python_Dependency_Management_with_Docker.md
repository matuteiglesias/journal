**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to streamline [[Python]] dependency management using Docker, focusing on creating a clean and efficient environment for [[Python]] projects, particularly [[Flask]] applications.

### Key Activities
- **Docker Environment Setup**: Initiated a Docker container to identify and manage [[Python]] module dependencies, ensuring a clean environment.
- **Dynamic Import Check**: Developed a [[Python]] script to dynamically check for module imports within Docker, enhancing [[error handling]] without the need for container rebuilds.
- **Script Enhancement**: Enhanced the import check script to provide detailed output for each module's import status and included troubleshooting steps.
- **[[Flask]] Application Dependencies**: Outlined necessary modules for [[Flask]] applications and best practices for maintaining a `requirements.txt` file.
- **Version Management**: Implemented strategies for managing dataset and model versions in [[Flask]] applications, including version control and session management.
- **Temporary File Management**: Managed and cleaned up session-specific model files in [[Flask]], ensuring proper cleanup and [[error handling]].
- **Application Context Management**: Utilized `current_app` in [[Flask]] for effective application context management and resource cleanup.
- **Error Resolution**: Addressed `FileNotFoundError` issues related to model saving in [[Flask]] applications.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up a Docker environment for [[Python]] dependency management.
- Created a robust dynamic import check script with enhanced troubleshooting capabilities.
- Established a comprehensive approach to managing dependencies and version control in [[Flask]] applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and [[optimization]] of the dynamic import check script in different environments.
- [[Integration]] of the dependency management [[strategy]] with continuous integration pipelines for automated testing.
