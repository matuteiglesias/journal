**üïí 03:00‚Äì05:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: visualization, dynamic programming, activity selection, matplotlib, algorithm  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the visualization capabilities of various activity selection algorithms to improve understanding and [[debugging]].

### Key Activities
- Modified the `visualizar` method to display selected and unselected activities separately, adjusting the y-axis and using colors for differentiation.
- Integrated intermediate visualizations into the `GreedySelector` to show the state of activities after each decision using `matplotlib`.
- Adapted the `visualizar` method for `BacktrackingSelector` to graphically represent the state of selected and evaluated activities.
- Implemented visualizations in `DynamicProgrammingSelector` to demonstrate the memoization table filling and solution reconstruction.
- Reviewed and clarified the reconstruction logic in dynamic programming algorithms for activity selection, focusing on non-overlapping activities and improving decision-making clarity.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated visualization methods across different selectors, enhancing the understanding of algorithmic processes.
- Improved the clarity of dynamic programming implementations through detailed explanations and code examples.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the visualization methods in real-world scenarios to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- Continuous refinement of the reconstruction logic in dynamic programming to handle edge cases effectively.
