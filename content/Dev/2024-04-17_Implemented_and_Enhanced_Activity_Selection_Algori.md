### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to implement and enhance various activity selection algorithms using different approaches such as backtracking, dynamic programming, and greedy methods. The session also aimed to improve educational transparency by adding verbose outputs and visualizations.

### Key Activities
- Mapped exercises to Chapter 5 of Kleinberg and Tardos's Algorithm Design, focusing on divide and conquer techniques.
- Designed and implemented three versions of the activity selection algorithm using object-oriented programming: backtracking, dynamic programming, and greedy approaches.
- Enhanced the `BacktrackingSelector`, `DynamicProgrammingSelector`, and `GreedySelector` classes with verbose outputs to illustrate decision-making processes.
- Utilized `matplotlib` to visualize the activity selection process on a timeline, aiding in understanding and [[debugging]].

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented modular and reusable code for the activity selection algorithms.
- Improved educational value by providing clear visual and verbose outputs.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and [[optimization]] of the implemented algorithms.
- Exploration of additional visualization techniques to enhance understanding.
