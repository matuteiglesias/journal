## 📅 2024-04-17 — Session: Optimized Binary Search for i-th Element in Arrays

**🕒 17:20–18:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: algorithm, binary search, optimization, debugging, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize and correct an algorithm for finding the i-th element in two merged sorted arrays without fully merging them.

### Key Activities
- **Reflection on Algorithm [[Education]]:** Analyzed challenges in understanding recursive algorithms and logarithmic complexity, with recommendations for improved teaching strategies.
- **Algorithm Correction:** Identified and corrected issues in a binary search algorithm used for finding the i-th element in merged arrays, focusing on index management and element comparison logic.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Applied median-based decision-making and exponential search techniques to optimize the algorithm to O(log n) complexity.
- **[[Debugging]]:** Utilized print statements for step-by-step [[debugging]] of the `iesimo_merge` function.

### Achievements
- Successfully refined the `iesimo_merge` function to achieve logarithmic complexity.
- Enhanced the robustness and clarity of the binary search algorithm through improved index management and logic correction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the optimized algorithm in different scenarios to ensure robustness across edge cases.
