## 📅 2024-04-17 — Session: Refactored and Debugged Array and Tree Algorithms

**🕒 19:05–19:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Algorithm, Debugging, Python, Error Handling, Array Manipulation, Binary Tree  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and improve various algorithm implementations, focusing on pointer adjustments in merged arrays, error handling in closest pair algorithms, and debugging diameter calculations in binary trees.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a comparative analysis of pointer adjustment strategies in merged arrays, focusing on decision-making processes and optimization techniques.
- Implemented print statements in the `merge_and_count` and `closest_pair_of_points` functions to facilitate understanding and debugging.
- Corrected the `closest_split_pair` function to prevent a TypeError by ensuring a valid pair of points is returned.
- Addressed error handling in the `closest_pair_rec` function to manage base cases and ensure proper returns from `brute_force` and `closest_split_pair`.
- Debugged the `diameter_of_binary_tree` function by adding print statements to visualize traversal and calculations.

### Achievements
- Enhanced understanding of pointer adjustment optimizations in array merging.
- Improved error handling and debugging capabilities in closest pair and binary tree algorithms.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the modified algorithms to ensure robustness and efficiency in various scenarios.
