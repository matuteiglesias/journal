**üïí 20:30‚Äì21:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, GridSearchCV  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance a [[machine learning]] pipeline by implementing data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation techniques.

### Key Activities
- **[[Data Visualization]]**: Created scatter plots for geometric log variables to understand their relationship with pricing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Evaluated feature relevance in model development using exploratory [[data analysis]].
- **Data Preprocessing**: Developed a preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn`, including outlier removal and feature transformations.
- **Model Implementation**: Implemented a Random Forest model with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using diagnostic plots and metrics post hyperparameter tuning.
- **Optimization**: Explored strategies to manage overfitting in decision tree models, focusing on `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf`.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and visualized data relationships and preprocessing steps.
- Implemented a robust Random Forest model with optimized hyperparameters.
- Evaluated model performance with comprehensive metrics and visual diagnostics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
- Additional experiments with different models and hyperparameter settings to improve performance.
