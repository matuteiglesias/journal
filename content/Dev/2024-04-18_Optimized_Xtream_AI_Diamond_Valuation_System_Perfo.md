### Session Goal:
The session aimed to optimize the performance of the Xtream [[AI]] Diamond Valuation System through a series of structured tasks focusing on benchmarking, code optimization, and performance monitoring.

### Key Activities:
- Developed a performance and optimization checklist for the Xtream [[AI]] system, covering benchmarking, code optimization, and load handling.
- Conducted a performance review and benchmarking to identify KPIs and establish baseline measurements.
- Set up and monitored KPIs such as response time, throughput, CPU, and memory usage.
- Integrated performance monitoring features into the application UI using [[Flask]] and JavaScript.
- Implemented [[API]] performance testing for backend and frontend using [[Flask]] and JavaScript.
- Diagnosed and resolved 404 errors in [[Flask]] applications, focusing on endpoint path correctness and request method handling.
- Profiled and optimized the `/retrain` endpoint using [[Python]]'s `cProfile` and `line_profiler`.
- Enhanced MLflow model logging performance by optimizing subprocess communication and caching.

### Achievements:
- Successfully integrated performance monitoring into the application UI.
- Implemented [[API]] performance testing and resolved 404 errors in [[Flask]] endpoints.
- Optimized model retraining processes and MLflow model logging.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further optimization of MLflow's `log_model` function to reduce execution time.
- Analysis of diamond ratios in histograms for better understanding of gemology standards.
