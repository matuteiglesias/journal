## üìÖ 2024-04-19 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Flask API for Dynamic Model Management

**üïí 04:40‚Äì06:24**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flask, API, Machine Learning, Debugging, UI  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance a [[Flask]] [[API]] to support dynamic model management, including preprocessing, [[error handling]], and user interface updates.

### Key Activities
- **Modified Preprocessing Function**: Adapted the preprocessing function to handle both dictionary and DataFrame inputs, ensuring consistent feature processing for predictions.
- **Revised `/predict` Endpoint**: Enhanced the `/predict` endpoint to dynamically load the latest model and preprocessor files, improving [[error handling]] and [[data processing]].
- **Resolved Import Errors**: Addressed various import errors in the [[Flask]] application by adjusting the [[Python]] path, using `__init__.py`, and refining import statements.
- **Filtered Model Files**: Implemented a filter to exclude preprocessor files from the model list in the [[API]] response.
- **UI Enhancements**: Updated the user interface to display model version and metrics, and implemented an auto-refresh feature for the model information table.
- **[[Debugging]]**: Added debug statements to the `/predict` endpoint to trace data flow and identify issues.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented dynamic model and preprocessor loading in the [[Flask]] [[API]].
- Improved [[error handling]] and [[data processing]] in the `/predict` endpoint.
- Enhanced user interface with auto-refresh and simplified model information display.
- Resolved import errors, ensuring smooth module recognition and application functionality.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the auto-refresh feature in various browsers and environments to ensure consistency.
- Continued monitoring of the `/predict` endpoint for any additional [[debugging]] needs.
