### Session Goal
The primary objective was to enhance the integration of [[machine learning]] models with a [[Flask]] [[API]], incorporating MLflow for logging and tracking.

### Key Activities
- Developed a `train_and_evaluate_model` function to encapsulate training of a `RandomForestRegressor` and integrated it into a [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint.
- Updated the [[Flask]] endpoint to include MLflow logging for model retraining, ensuring parameters and metrics are logged effectively.
- Implemented functionality to save model predictions and actual values as [[CSV]] files in MLflow, along with generating diagnostic plots.
- Corrected a [[Flask]] route to ensure proper integration with MLflow, fixing the `return` statement alignment.
- Revised the `/predict` endpoint to select the latest model and preprocessor, enhancing [[error handling]] and managing missing values.
- Reviewed best practices for [[Python]] module imports to improve project structure and maintainability.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated MLflow logging into the [[Flask]] [[API]], improving model tracking and experiment management.
- Enhanced the `/predict` endpoint for better model and preprocessor selection, ensuring robust [[error handling]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing is required to validate the robustness of the updated endpoints and logging mechanisms.
- Consider implementing additional error logging and monitoring for the [[Flask]] application.
