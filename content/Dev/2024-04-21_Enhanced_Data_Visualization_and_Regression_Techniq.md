## üìÖ 2024-04-21 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Data Visualization and Regression Techniques

**üïí 04:30‚Äì05:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: data visualization, regression, Python, matplotlib, health  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to improve [[data visualization]] techniques and explore regression methods for predicting body measurements and weight.

### Key Activities:
- **Color Customization for Line Charts**: Adjusted line chart colors for better visibility and accessibility using [[Python]]'s matplotlib.
- **Boxplot Improvements**: Enhanced boxplot readability by grouping weeks into months and rotating x-axis labels.
- **Unique Month-Year Labels for Boxplots**: Created boxplots with unique month-year labels by modifying DataFrame and plotting functions.
- **Regression Techniques for Weight Prediction**: Explored various regression techniques, including multiple linear regression and polynomial regression, for modeling body measurements and weight relationships.
- **Quadratic Curve Fitting**: Implemented quadratic curve fitting using numpy's polyfit function.
- **Centering Quadratic Models**: Centered quadratic models around specific x-values for better data transformation.
- **Weight Prediction Models**: Developed quadratic models to predict weight from body measurements.
- **Inverting Quadratic Equations**: Used quadratic equations to estimate body measurements from weight.
- **Data Imputation**: Created a [[Python]] function for imputing missing body measurements using a quadratic fit.

### Achievements:
- Successfully customized visualization techniques for improved data readability and accessibility.
- Developed and implemented regression models for accurate weight prediction based on body measurements.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further validation of regression models with additional datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- Exploration of alternative visualization libraries for enhanced data representation.
