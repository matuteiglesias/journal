## 📅 2024-04-23 — Session: Developed Docker setup for diamond price predictor

**🕒 22:30–23:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Docker, Flask, Machine Learning, Git, Diamond Pricing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to set up a Docker environment for a diamond price prediction application, leveraging [[machine learning]] models within a [[Flask]] web application.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed Git push history to understand past changes and ensure the latest updates are used.
- Planned a sophisticated model for predicting diamond prices, which involves [[data analysis]] and predictive modeling.
- Conceptualized a web application using [[Flask]] for real-time diamond price prediction, emphasizing user interaction.
- Executed Docker setup instructions, including cloning the repository, building a Docker image, and running the application.
- Cloned the `localdev` branch from the [[GitHub]] repository to ensure the correct environment setup.
- Organized project files and directories, providing detailed usage scenarios for effective application interaction.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up the Docker environment and ensured the application is ready for further development and testing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the predictive model and integrate it into the [[Flask]] application.
- Conduct thorough testing of the application to ensure reliability and accuracy in predictions.
