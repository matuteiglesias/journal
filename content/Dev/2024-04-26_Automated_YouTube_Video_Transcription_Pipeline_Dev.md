**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Youtube, Automation, Google Cloud, Transcription  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop an automated pipeline for downloading YouTube videos and transcribing their audio using [[Python]] and [[Google Cloud]]'s Speech-to-Text [[API]].

### Key Activities:
- **YouTube Video Download and Transcription Script**: Developed a [[Python]] script using `youtube-dl` and [[Google Cloud]]'s Speech-to-Text [[API]] to download and transcribe YouTube videos.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] youtube-dl Errors**: Addressed issues with `youtube-dl`, including updating the tool and using `yt-dlp` as an alternative.
- **Resolving `RegexNotFoundError`**: Investigated and resolved `RegexNotFoundError` by updating to `yt-dlp`.
- **Correct Usage of youtube-dl Command**: Ensured correct command usage with `--verbose` flag and explored `yt-dlp` for improved performance.
- **Switching to yt-dlp**: Transitioned from `youtube-dl` to `yt-dlp` for video downloading and audio extraction.
- **Script for Downloading Audio with yt-dlp**: Adapted existing scripts for compatibility with `yt-dlp`.
- **Setup Guide for [[Google Cloud]] Speech-to-Text [[API]]**: Set up [[Google Cloud]]'s Speech-to-Text service, including [[API]] enabling and authentication.

### Achievements:
- Successfully developed a script for downloading and transcribing YouTube videos using `yt-dlp` and [[Google Cloud]]'s [[API]].
- Resolved technical issues related to video downloading and transcription.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the transcription accuracy and performance.
- [[Integration]] of error handling mechanisms for robust pipeline execution.
