**üïí 13:05‚Äì14:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Google Cloud, Speech-to-Text, Python, Troubleshooting, Audio Processing  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve various issues related to the [[Google Cloud]] Speech-to-Text [[API]], focusing on installation, configuration, and audio processing challenges.

### Key Activities
- **Installation [[Troubleshooting]]**: Addressed installation and configuration issues with the `google-cloud-speech` library in [[Python]].
- **Payload Size [[Error Handling]]**: Implemented solutions for handling `InvalidArgument` exceptions due to audio file size limits by using `ffmpeg` for audio extraction and script modification.
- **Project Management**: Guided steps for changing the active [[Google Cloud]] project both in the console and via the `gcloud` command-line tool.
- **Configuration [[Troubleshooting]]**: Ensured correct project configuration in [[Python]] applications by managing environment variables and [[API]] settings.
- **Authentication Resolution**: Updated Application Default Credentials to resolve authentication issues.
- **Audio Processing**: Converted stereo audio to mono and optimized audio files for [[API]] compatibility and performance.
- **Handling Long Audio Files**: Transitioned from synchronous to asynchronous processing for long audio files.
- **Streaming Transcription Setup**: Developed a [[Python]] setup for real-time audio streaming to the [[API]].
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Streaming Issues**: Identified and resolved common streaming transcription problems.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved installation, configuration, and authentication issues with the [[Google Cloud]] Speech-to-Text [[API]].
- Enhanced audio processing techniques to comply with [[API]] requirements and improve efficiency.
- Established methods for handling large and streaming audio files effectively.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of asynchronous and streaming transcription methods to ensure robustness and reliability in different scenarios.
