**üïí 12:45‚Äì14:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: GitHub Actions, Python, Automation, Data Processing, Machine Learning  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance [[automation]] workflows using [[GitHub]] Actions and improve [[data processing]] scripts for [[machine learning]] projects.

### Key Activities
- Implemented temporary directory creation in [[GitHub]] Actions to ensure file operations run smoothly.
- Resolved git push errors by ensuring local changes are aligned with remote repositories.
- Explored various git branch merge strategies including merge, rebase, and fast-forward.
- Enhanced logging in [[Python]] [[data processing]] scripts for better [[debugging]] and tracking.
- Updated [[GitHub]] Actions workflows to manage [[Python]] script outputs and ensure data persistence.
- Configured Git settings in [[GitHub]] Actions for accurate commit tracking.
- Developed strategies for handling pooled urban areas in regression models and simulated city code `0` in datasets using [[Python]].
- Implemented [[GitHub]] Actions workflows to check file sizes and automate [[data processing]] tasks.
- Addressed [[error handling]] in model training scripts and automated model updates using [[GitHub]] Actions.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated and tested multiple [[GitHub]] Actions workflows to automate [[data processing]] and model training tasks.
- Improved [[data processing]] scripts with enhanced logging and [[error handling]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of [[GitHub]] Actions workflows for more complex [[automation]] scenarios.
- Continuous integration of new [[data processing]] techniques into the existing framework.
