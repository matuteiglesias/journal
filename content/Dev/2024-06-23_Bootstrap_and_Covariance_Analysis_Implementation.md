### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement and refine statistical methods for [[data analysis]], focusing on bootstrap sampling and covariance computation.

### Key Activities
- **Bootstrap Analysis and Covariance Computation**: Implemented bootstrap methods for variance analysis and computed covariance of components using [[Pandas]].
- **Function Development**: Developed the `calculate_aggregates` function in [[Python]] to compute statistical aggregates related to sales data, including covariance and variance.
- **Enhanced Covariance Function**: Improved the `covariance_and_save` function to support quantile and scale options, adding detailed comments for clarity.
- **Unified Function Implementation**: Created a unified function `bootstrap_and_simulation` to integrate bootstrap sampling and simulation processes, enhancing [[data processing]] efficiency.
- **Algorithm Development**: Designed algorithms for distribution analysis and macro moments independence experiments, ensuring robust data generation and result analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and refined multiple [[Python]] functions for statistical analysis.
- Enhanced understanding and efficiency of [[data processing]] methods.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented functions in diverse data scenarios.
