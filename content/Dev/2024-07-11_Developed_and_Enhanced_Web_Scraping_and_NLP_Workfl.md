**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop and enhance workflows for web scraping and natural language processing ([[NLP]]), focusing on robust data extraction and improved entity recognition.

### Key Activities
- **[[Web Scraping]] [[Workflow]]**: Designed comprehensive workflows for scraping webpages, extracting key information, and recognizing entities using tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, spaCy, and [[Pandas]].
- **[[Data Processing]]**: Implemented structured workflows for processing URLs, extracting data, and storing it in structured formats using SQLite and [[Pandas]].
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Enhanced the `scrape_page` function to handle SSL errors and other request exceptions, improving the robustness of the scraping process.
- **HTML Cleaning**: Updated the `clean_html` function to remove multiple spaces, tabs, and newlines, ensuring clean text output.
- **Entity Recognition**: Improved entity recognition accuracy through preprocessing, custom model training, and post-processing techniques.
- **Spanish [[NLP]]**: Utilized spaCy with pre-trained Spanish models for entity extraction tasks.

### Achievements
- Developed robust web scraping scripts with SSL and HTTP error handling.
- Enhanced entity recognition accuracy and data cleaning processes.
- Implemented workflows for text classification using machine learning models, including BERT and Scikit-Learn.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced workflows and models in different environments.
- Exploration of additional [[NLP]] models and techniques for improved accuracy.
