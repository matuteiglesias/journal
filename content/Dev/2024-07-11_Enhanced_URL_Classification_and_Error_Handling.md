## üìÖ 2024-07-11 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced URL Classification and Error Handling

**üïí 21:20‚Äì23:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: URL Classification, Error Handling, OpenAI API, Python, Elasticsearch  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to integrate and enhance various components of a URL classification system using [[OpenAI]]'s [[API]], focusing on improving [[error handling]] and [[data processing]].

### Key Activities
- Integrated BERT with Elasticsearch for text classification.
- Developed a comprehensive [[workflow]] for creating a knowledge web, including data collection, processing, and visualization.
- Implemented an [[AI]] agent using GPT-4 for dataset labeling to fine-tune a BERT model.
- Developed a [[Python]]-based URL classification system using [[OpenAI]] [[API]], including class definition and example usage.
- Addressed errors in the URLClassifier class, specifically fixing argument errors in the `construct_prompt` method and handling null values in input fields.
- Enhanced HTML cleaning using BeautifulSoup to improve text extraction quality.
- Implemented robust [[error handling]] in DataFrame classification using try-except blocks.
- Improved entity recognition using spaCy by refining extraction processes and filtering irrelevant content.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated BERT with Elasticsearch and developed a comprehensive knowledge web [[workflow]].
- Implemented a robust URL classification system with enhanced [[error handling]].
- Improved [[data processing]] and entity recognition techniques using [[Python]] and spaCy.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced URL classification system.
- Optimization of the knowledge web [[workflow]] for scalability and performance.
