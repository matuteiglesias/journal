## 📅 2024-07-14 — Session: Developed Python Scripts for Text Filtering and Pattern Matching

**🕒 00:50–01:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Regex, Text Processing, Automation, GCP  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for filtering text files and identifying specific patterns within the text.

### Key Activities
- **File Upload Request**: The session began with a request to upload the missing `outline.txt` file necessary for processing.
- **Script [[Development]]**: Multiple [[Python]] scripts were developed and revised to filter lines in a text file and identify lines matching the 'int.int' regex pattern.
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Enhanced the scripts to ensure flexibility in matching patterns with any preceding or following characters.
- **[[Documentation]] Review**: Reviewed chapters from 'Mastering Data Engineering and [[Machine Learning]] on [[Google Cloud]] Platform' focusing on automation, job scheduling, and monitoring ML solutions.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and refined [[Python]] scripts for text filtering and pattern matching.
- Gained insights into automation and job scheduling on [[Google Cloud]] Platform.
- Reviewed monitoring strategies for ML solutions, focusing on risk management and bias.

### Pending Tasks
- Upload the `outline.txt` file to complete the processing and testing of the scripts.
