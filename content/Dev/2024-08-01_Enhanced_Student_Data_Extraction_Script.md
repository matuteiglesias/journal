**🕒 22:30–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Web Scraping, Data Extraction  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to develop and enhance a [[Python]] script using Selenium and BeautifulSoup for extracting student data from web pages efficiently.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract student information from web pages.
- Ensured data was stored in [[Pandas]] DataFrames and exported to [[CSV]] files, avoiding duplicates by checking URL IDs.
- Modified the Selenium script to manage browser sessions and tabs effectively, improving [[error handling]] and robustness.
- Addressed deprecation warnings and index errors in the data extraction script.
- Updated the script to replace the `append` method with `pd.concat` in [[Pandas]] for better performance.
- Implemented checks for handling empty tables during data extraction.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a robust data extraction script that handles sessions and errors efficiently.
- Improved the script's performance and reliability by addressing deprecation warnings and optimizing DataFrame operations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the script in diverse environments to ensure consistent performance.
- Explore additional optimizations for handling large datasets.
