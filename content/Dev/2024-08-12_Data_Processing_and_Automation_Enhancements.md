**🕒 12:40–19:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Processing, Automation, Python, Social Media, Server Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to enhance data processing techniques and automate file synchronization tasks.

### Key Activities
- **[[Data Processing]] with [[Pandas]]**: Implemented quarterly resampling and interpolation techniques on a DataFrame using [[Pandas]]. Optimized data processing code for readability and efficiency.
- **Command Line and Server Management**: Utilized Linux command line tools to manage disk usage, SSH access, and file management. Explored the use of `tree` and `du` commands.
- **Social Media [[Strategy]]**: Developed Instagram content for Ciclo Todes, focusing on community engagement and inclusivity.
- **[[Error Handling]] in [[Python]]**: Enhanced code robustness by implementing exception handling in data processing scripts.
- **[[Automation]] with Rsync and Cron**: Automated file synchronization between local and server using `rsync` and `cron` jobs, including troubleshooting and optimizing the process.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored data processing pipelines for better performance and clarity.
- Developed a comprehensive strategy for automating web page updates using `rsync` and `cron`.
- Improved server management skills through practical command line exercises.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the automation scripts to handle edge cases and improve logging.
- Continue developing social media strategies for broader engagement.
