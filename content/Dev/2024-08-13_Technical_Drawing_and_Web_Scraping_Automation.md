### Session Goal
The session aimed to create a detailed technical drawing of a mountain bike with parts labeled in Spanish and to automate the parsing of Google search results for social media profiles using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a prompt for creating a technical drawing of a mountain bike, with labeled parts in Spanish.
- Provided a list of mountain bike parts translated into Spanish.
- Outlined strategies for estimating population sizes using Bayesian inference.
- Discussed voter segmentation for engagement strategies.
- Implemented methods to prevent unintended merges with NaN values in [[Pandas]].
- Created Google search URLs in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame.
- Developed [[automation]] for Google search result parsing using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- Addressed Google CAPTCHA and 429 errors with proxy strategies.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a template for a technical drawing of a mountain bike.
- Automated the extraction of social media profiles from Google search results using concurrent processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the proxy management and [[error handling]] strategies in web scraping.
