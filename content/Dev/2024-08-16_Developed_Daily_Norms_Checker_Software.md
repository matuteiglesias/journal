- **Software Architecture Design:** Developed a framework for web scraping, including pagination handling and data storage.
- **[[Web Scraping]] Implementation:** Created a [[Python]] script to scrape resolution data, handle pagination, and store data in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame.
- **[[Error Handling]] in [[Python]]:** Modified scripts to handle missing elements safely.
- **URL Function Development:** Designed a function to generate search URLs for Buenos Aires norms with specific parameters.
- **Daily Data Scraping Script:** Implemented a [[Python]] script for daily data scraping and [[CSV]] logging.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a comprehensive software architecture for automated web scraping of government norms.
- Implemented error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure robust data extraction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the scraping software to ensure reliability and accuracy.
- [[Deployment]] of the software for continuous operation.
