### Session Goal
The session aimed to verify LAPACK routine solutions and explore advanced linear algebra techniques, including Gaussian elimination, Jordan block structures, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Key Activities
- Verified the solution of the LAPACK routine `DGETRS` using LU factorization to ensure it satisfies the equation A ¬∑ X = B.
- Conducted Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting on a 4x4 matrix, covering matrix setup, elimination, and back substitution.
- Provided an in-depth guide on Jordan block structures and Jordan canonical forms, explaining their significance and computation methods.
- Reflected on the evolution and impact of LAPACK in numerical linear algebra, highlighting its innovations and relevance.
- Implemented a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) routine for complex matrices, detailing initialization, decomposition, and QR iteration.
- Explained how to compute the null space of a matrix using SVD, providing an intuitive understanding of the concept.
- Explored methods for computing the kernel of a matrix, focusing on SVD as an efficient technique.

### Achievements
- Successfully verified LAPACK routine solutions and deepened understanding of linear algebra techniques.
- Developed comprehensive guides and reflections on key matrix operations and their applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of alternative methods for computing the kernel of a matrix beyond SVD.
