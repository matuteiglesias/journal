## üìÖ 2024-08-22 ‚Äî Session: Python Data Processing and Markdown Generation

**üïí 05:10‚Äì08:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Markdown, Error Handling, Openoffice  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for processing data and generating markdown outputs. This involved handling data grouping, percentage calculations, and markdown formatting.

### Key Activities
- **Force Quit OpenOffice Calc**: Instructions were provided on using terminal commands like `killall`, `pkill`, `xkill`, and manual methods to force quit OpenOffice Calc.
- **[[Python]] Script Development**: Created a [[Python]] script to read [[CSV]] files, group data by specific columns, and generate markdown outputs.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Resolved a ValueError related to unpacking in [[Python]], ensuring correct markdown string concatenation.
- **[[Data Analysis]]**: Implemented functions to calculate group percentages and sort groups by these percentages before generating markdown.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a comprehensive [[Python]] script that processes data, calculates group percentages, and generates organized markdown outputs.
- Improved error handling and refined the logic for processing small groups.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and optimization of the script for larger datasets.
- [[Integration]] of the script into a broader data processing pipeline.
