## 📅 2024-08-26 — Session: Resolved Pandas and NumPy Compatibility Issues

**🕒 22:20–22:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, NumPy, DataFrame, Troubleshooting, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve various issues encountered during DataFrame manipulation using [[Pandas]] and NumPy in [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Investigated potential causes for errors when adding new columns to a DataFrame, focusing on conflicts with NumPy and memory issues.
- Explored solutions for unusual errors in [[Pandas]] DataFrame column creation, including checks for corrupted data and library conflicts.
- Addressed compatibility issues between NumPy 2.x and libraries compiled with NumPy 1.x by downgrading NumPy and rebuilding the environment.
- Updated the [[Pandas]] `stack` method to avoid `FutureWarning` by including the `future_stack=True` parameter.
- Implemented robust handling of NaN values in DataFrame indexing using `idxmax()`.
- Utilized [[Pandas]] for selecting rows with the latest timestamp for each group, simplifying the process with `groupby` and `transform`.
- Resolved `SettingWithCopyWarning` and `FutureWarning` in [[Pandas]] by using `.loc` for DataFrame assignments.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved compatibility issues between [[Pandas]] and NumPy.
- Improved DataFrame manipulation techniques to avoid common warnings and errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Continuous monitoring for any further compatibility issues with future library updates.
- Review and optimize DataFrame operations for performance improvements.
