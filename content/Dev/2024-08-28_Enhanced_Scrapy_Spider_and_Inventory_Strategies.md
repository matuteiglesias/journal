## 📅 2024-08-28 — Session: Enhanced Scrapy Spider and Inventory Strategies

**🕒 22:40–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Scrapy, Web Scraping, Inventory Management, Python, Data Export  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the performance of a Scrapy spider for web scraping tasks and to explore strategic inventory management techniques for both personal and business applications.

### Key Activities
1. **Data Cleaning**: Implemented a [[Python]] function to iteratively remove outliers from a DataFrame using standard deviations.
2. **[[Web Scraping]] Optimization**: 
   - Reviewed a report on the spider's scraping performance.
   - Optimized the Scrapy spider by reducing requests, implementing asynchronous processing, and optimizing data handling.
   - Set up a Scrapy spider to extract `ProductoCategorizadoItem` and modified the `MultiCSVItemPipeline` for categorized product output.
   - Debugged the spider to ensure proper processing and exporting of categorized items.
3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Explored value investing principles in retail purchases by tracking prices and buying in bulk.
   - Discussed opportunistic purchasing and strategic stockpiling strategies.
   - Applied Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Just-In-Time (JIT) strategies for home inventory [[optimization]].

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized the Scrapy spider for improved performance and data export capabilities.
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of inventory management strategies that can be applied to both personal and business contexts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the Scrapy spider and inventory strategies to ensure robustness and efficiency.
