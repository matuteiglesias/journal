## 📅 2024-08-28 — Session: Web Scraping Optimization and Project Structuring

**🕒 20:15–20:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Web Scraping, Project Structuring, Scrapy, Postgresql, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to optimize the web scraping process for collecting time-series data and to plan the directory structure for a related project.

### Key Activities
- Discussed strategies for optimizing web scraping focused on time-series data collection, including filtering and automation.
- Planned a directory structure for the 'preciosclaros' project, integrating with time-series databases like TimescaleDB and InfluxDB.
- Proposed a reorganized directory structure for a crawler project to enhance clarity and scalability.
- Outlined SQL scripts for PostgreSQL database initialization and management.
- Reviewed the crawler code to ensure compatibility with the new directory structure.
- Tested the functionality of a Scrapy crawler and troubleshot project recognition and module import errors.
- Debugged a Scrapy spider using ipdb.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive plan for optimizing web scraping processes.
- Established a clear directory structure for the project, ensuring integration with necessary databases.
- Ensured the crawler code is compatible with the new structure and tested its functionality.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and implementation of the directory structure and database scripts.
- Continuous monitoring and debugging of the web scraping process as needed.
