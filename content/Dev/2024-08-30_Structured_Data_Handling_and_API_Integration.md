### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data parsing functions and improve [[API]] integration for efficient data handling and analysis.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] function to analyze financing options with installment-based payment structures.
- Outlined workflows for market analysis and data scraping, including [[error handling]] and modularization.
- Resolved MercadoLibre [[API]] authorization errors and troubleshot localhost environment issues.
- Improved code organization for [[API]] integration, focusing on [[error handling]] and modular programming.
- Structured data from MercadoLibre [[API]] into relational tables using [[Python]] and SQLAlchemy.
- Enhanced [[JSON]] parsing functions to capture unhandled data and implemented logging for robustness.
- Developed parsing functions for e-commerce product attributes, organizing data into separate DataFrames.
- Enhanced the `parse_product` function for safe access and [[error handling]].

### Achievements
- Successfully improved data handling processes and [[API]] integration strategies.
- Enhanced robustness and flexibility of data parsing functions.
- Established a structured approach for organizing and storing data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine data parsing functions for additional product attributes.
