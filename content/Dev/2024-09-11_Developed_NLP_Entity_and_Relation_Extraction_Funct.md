**üïí 00:10‚Äì23:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: NLP, Python, entity extraction, relation extraction, spaCy, legal text  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance natural language processing ([[NLP]]) capabilities by developing and improving functions for entity and relation extraction, particularly focusing on legal texts and complex sentence structures.

### Key Activities
- **Challenging Two-Sector Economic Problem:** Explored economic models related to demand shock in a two-sector economy, utilizing the Leontief inverse.
- **System of Equations for Energy and Manufacturing Sectors:** Analyzed the impact of increased demand in the Manufacturing sector on both Energy and Manufacturing outputs.
- **LaTeX Formatted Answer Options:** Created LaTeX formatted multiple-choice answers for educational purposes.
- **Extract Encrypted PDF Link:** Developed a [[Python]] function using BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract PDF links.
- **Appointment Summary:** Summarized the appointment of a new director in Buenos Aires, focusing on legal and publication details.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Outlined a [[workflow]] for building knowledge graphs from natural language summaries.
- **Entity and Relationship Extraction Function:** Developed a [[Python]] function using spaCy and networkx for extracting entities and relationships.
- **Improving Entity and Relation Extraction:** Enhanced [[Python]] code for better parsing and relation extraction in legal texts.
- **Relation Extraction Improvements:** Analyzed and improved relation extraction functions, focusing on complex sentence structures.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and improved multiple [[NLP]] functions for entity and relation extraction.
- Enhanced the parsing and extraction capabilities for legal texts and complex sentences.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the improved [[NLP]] functions in diverse text domains.
- [[Integration]] of the developed functions into broader [[NLP]] workflows.
