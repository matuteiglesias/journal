**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the functionality and user interaction of [[JavaScript]]-based mapping applications, specifically focusing on dynamic layer management using Leaflet and D3.js.

### Key Activities
- **Fixed Marker Layer Assignment in D3.js**: Corrected marker assignments to their respective layer groups in a D3.js map, ensuring proper visibility control.
- **Configured Spiderfy Effect in Leaflet**: Enabled and configured the spiderfy effect in Leaflet's marker clustering for optimal visibility.
- **Customized Leaflet Marker Cluster Styles**: Applied CSS customization for marker clusters to enhance visual aesthetics.
- **Implemented Dynamic Layer Management**: Utilized structured [[JSON]] to manage categories and dynamically create FeatureGroup layers.
- **Loaded Categories from [[JSON]]**: Employed fetch [[API]] to load category data from [[JSON]], facilitating dynamic map initialization.
- **Refactored Code for Dynamic Layer Access**: Improved code efficiency by dynamically accessing layers from the `layerGroups` object.
- **Updated Visibility Control**: Modified the `addVisibilityControl` function for dynamic layer management.
- **Optimized Script Structure**: Enhanced code readability and efficiency in handling dynamically loaded data.
- **Fixed L.Control.ubicacion Error**: Corrected an error in Leaflet by properly extending `L.Control`.
- **Implemented Master Toggle for Layer Visibility**: Added a master toggle button for controlling visibility of multiple categories in a Leaflet map.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the mapping application's user interaction and efficiency by implementing dynamic layer management and visibility control.
- Improved code maintainability and readability through refactoring and [[optimization]] efforts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented features in different environments.
- Exploration of additional customization options for map aesthetics.
