### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to deploy a web application on [[Google Cloud]] App Engine, ensuring it runs smoothly with correct configurations and permissions.

### Key Activities
- Followed a guide to set up, prepare, deploy, and test a web app on [[Google Cloud]] using App Engine.
- Chose and found a unique [[Google Cloud]] Project ID using the `gcloud` command-line tool.
- Ensured the Project ID met the length requirement of at least 6 characters.
- Deployed a static web application on Google App Engine, including setting up the project, organizing files, and creating an `app.yaml` configuration.
- Ran the project locally using [[Python]]'s HTTP server to ensure functionality before deployment.
- Renamed the project folder and deployed it to Google App Engine, confirming the deployment.
- Fixed permissions errors for the service account accessing a Cloud Storage bucket.
- Resolved access issues for the App Engine service account related to Cloud Storage bucket permissions.
- Used the `gcloud app browse` command to open the deployed App Engine app in a web browser.
- Fixed MIME type errors in JavaScript file deployment by modifying the `app.yaml` configuration.

### Achievements
- Successfully deployed the web application on [[Google Cloud]] App Engine.
- Resolved all encountered issues including project ID setup, folder management, permissions, and MIME type errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the deployed application for any further issues or performance improvements.
