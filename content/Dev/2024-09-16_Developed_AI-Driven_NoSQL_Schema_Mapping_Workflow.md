### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a workflow for mapping natural language texts into structured NoSQL schemas using [[AI]] agents, particularly leveraging OpenAI's tools.

### Key Activities
- Explored the use of [[AI]] agents constrained by a NoSQL schema to map extracted entities from texts into structured data fields.
- Outlined a dynamic workflow for [[AI]]-driven NoSQL schema mapping, enhancing data interaction and flexibility.
- Compared Text-to-SQL tasks with the goal of mapping legal texts into NoSQL schemas, focusing on flexible data extraction.
- Detailed the process of transforming natural language texts into NoSQL schemas, including steps like entity recognition and relationship extraction.
- Utilized OpenAI's tools to extract entities and convert them into NoSQL schemas, including [[API]] usage and model fine-tuning.
- Provided a structured guide for teaching [[AI]] agents to generate NoSQL schemas using OpenAI Functions.
- Compiled questions for [[API]] documentation to clarify OpenAI Functions usage, focusing on [[JSON]] schema and error handling.
- Discussed key points on [[JSON]] schema structure and NoSQL management.
- Reflected on fine-tuning models with OpenAI Functions, best practices, and dataset size recommendations.
- Outlined [[API]] limitations and cost considerations for using OpenAI Functions.
- Defined tasks for Project Manager and Lead Developer for initial project phases.
- Provided Bash commands for project setup and OpenAI Functions implementation.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive workflow for [[AI]]-driven NoSQL schema mapping.
- Established guidelines for using OpenAI Functions effectively.
- Identified key considerations for fine-tuning and cost management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the workflow based on [[API]] documentation clarifications.
- Implement the workflow in a live environment and monitor performance.
- Explore additional fine-tuning techniques to optimize schema generation.
