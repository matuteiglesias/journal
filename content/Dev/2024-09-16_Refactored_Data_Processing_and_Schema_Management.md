**üïí 22:00‚Äì23:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: data_processing, schema_management, Python, NoSQL, AI  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to improve [[data processing]] workflows and schema management in various contexts, including NoSQL data handling and [[Python]] programming.

### Key Activities
- **Repairing Bedroom Walls with Enduido**: Outlined a guide for using wall filler to repair bedroom walls, covering preparation to painting.
- **Optimizing NoSQL [[Data Processing]] Workflow**: Developed a [[workflow]] to enhance efficiency by avoiding reprocessing of previously handled resolutions.
- **Fixing Schema Key Interpretation in [[JSON]] Parsing**: Resolved issues with schema key interpretation in [[JSON]] parsing, ensuring correct handling as lists.
- **Refinement of Schema Key Handling in [[Python]] Code**: Improved [[Python]] functions for schema key processing, using `ast.literal_eval` judiciously.
- **Analysis of NoSQL Schema for Resolution 172/2024**: Analyzed and recommended improvements for a NoSQL schema.
- **Enhancements for Data Extraction**: Planned improvements for data extraction processes focusing on financial data and committee mentions.
- **Preventing Model Hallucination in Schema-Based Data Extraction**: Outlined strategies to prevent [[AI]] model hallucinations by enforcing schema adherence.
- **Reinforcing Schema Enforcement in [[OpenAI]] Function Calls**: Structured approach to ensure schema enforcement in [[OpenAI]] [[API]] calls.
- **Enhancing Schema Extraction Logic**: Modified the `extract_parameters` function to preserve nested fields in schema extraction.

### Achievements
- Established a more efficient NoSQL [[data processing]] [[workflow]].
- Improved schema key handling in [[JSON]] and [[Python]] scripts.
- Developed strategies to prevent [[AI]] model hallucinations in data extraction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced [[data processing]] workflows and schema management strategies.
- Implementation of recommended improvements in NoSQL schemas.
