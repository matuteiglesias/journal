### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement and refine LU decomposition algorithms in [[Python]], focusing on numerical stability and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a non-destructive version of Gaussian Elimination using [[Python]] and NumPy.
- Implemented LU decomposition steps, including matrix inversion and solving systems of equations.
- Refactored code for execution in Jupyter notebooks.
- Enhanced LU decomposition with partial and full pivoting to improve numerical stability.
- Addressed common errors such as 'singular matrix' and `UFuncTypeError` by improving [[error handling]] and type casting.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented LU decomposition with both partial and full pivoting.
- Improved algorithm stability and [[error handling]].
- Provided complete code examples and detailed explanations for each step.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and [[optimization]] of the LU decomposition algorithm for large matrices.
- Exploration of additional numerical methods to enhance performance.
