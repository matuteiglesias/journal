**üïí 14:50‚Äì15:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Mapbox, ARCGIS, cost optimization, geospatial mapping, CLI  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to transition mapping projects from ARCGIS to Mapbox due to cost [[optimization]] concerns and to explore the capabilities of Mapbox for geospatial mapping.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed the 'Mapa Estad√≠stico de la Pobreza' project, focusing on using Mapbox for interactive web maps to visualize socioeconomic data in Argentina.
- Transitioned from ARCGIS to Mapbox, addressing initial challenges with the CLI that led to unexpected costs.
- Explored and documented best practices for using Mapbox, including cost benefits and learning experiences.

### Achievements
- Successfully transitioned the mapping project to Mapbox, optimizing costs and improving [[workflow]].
- Compiled a comprehensive guide comparing Mapbox with ARCGIS and other competitors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of the Mapbox [[workflow]] to enhance performance and cost-efficiency.
- Continued learning and adaptation to Mapbox features and updates.
