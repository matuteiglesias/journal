## 📅 2024-09-28 — Session: Enhanced Time Series Data Processing and Forecasting

**🕒 17:55–19:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Time Series, Data Processing, Forecasting, Pandas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the processing and forecasting capabilities for time series data using [[Python]], focusing on trend and seasonality extrapolation, data merging, and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] function for trend plus deviation extrapolation using linear regression and median deviations.
- Created methods for calculating monthly residuals and forecasting with seasonal deviations.
- Updated extrapolation functions to handle multiple columns in a pandas DataFrame.
- Improved employment [[data processing]] by including all relevant variables and optimizing the code.
- Streamlined EMAE data loading and processing, focusing on seasonality profiles.
- Developed a function to merge DataFrames without duplicate columns, ensuring clean data output.
- Enhanced DataFrame extrapolation and concatenation methods to avoid overlapping dates.
- Addressed DataFrame column reference errors and optimized time series data handling using `indice_tiempo`.
- Adapted functions to improve efficiency and [[error handling]] in time series forecasting.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and tested multiple [[Python]] functions for improved [[data processing]] and forecasting.
- Enhanced the robustness and efficiency of time series data handling and analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated functions with larger datasets.
- Documentation and integration of the new methods into existing workflows.
