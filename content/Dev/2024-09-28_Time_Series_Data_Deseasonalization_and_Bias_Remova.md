## 📅 2024-09-28 — Session: Time Series Data Deseasonalization and Bias Removal

**🕒 20:30–20:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: time series, deseasonalization, bias removal, Python, data analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to deseasonalize quarterly time series data, handle duplicate time index issues, and remove fixed bias using [[Python]] and the statsmodels library.

### Key Activities
- **Deseasonalizing Quarterly Data**: Utilized the `seasonal_decompose` function to remove seasonality from quarterly data.
- **Handling Duplicate Time Index**: Resolved issues with duplicate labels in the time index and updated the frequency to quarterly.
- **STL Decomposition**: Implemented STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS) to better handle seasonality.
- **Linear Interpolation and Bias Removal**: Transformed quarterly data into monthly frequency using linear interpolation and removed bias.
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: Removed fixed seasonal bias and adjusted data to compute fixed residuals.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented deseasonalization and bias removal techniques on quarterly data.
- Managed to resample and visualize data effectively using [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis may be needed on the impact of bias removal on forecast accuracy.
- Consider automating the process for larger datasets.
