**🕒 18:10–18:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Relationship Management, System Architecture, Productivity, Automation, Data Ingestion  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to explore and design a proposal for a relationship management module that integrates with existing systems to enhance productivity through task monitoring, calendar integration, and relationship management capabilities.

### Key Activities
- **Exploration of Relationship Management Module**: Discussed the addition of a module featuring task monitoring, calendar integration, and relationship management.
- **Overview and Design Considerations**: Outlined features and design considerations for the module, focusing on tracking interactions and managing contacts.
- **Layered Architecture Design**: Created a layered architecture diagram, detailing components for data ingestion, processing, storage, and integration of the relationship management module.
- **Data Ingestion Layer Diagram**: Developed a structured diagram for the Data Ingestion Layer, featuring various bots and their integration points.
- **Encoding Architecture with Code-Based Tools**: Explored tools like PlantUML, Mermaid.js, Terraform, AWS CDK, and the C4 Model for encoding system architectures.
- **Mermaid.js System Architecture Diagram**: Created a comprehensive diagram using Mermaid.js to illustrate the system architecture.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive proposal for a relationship management module.
- Designed detailed system architecture diagrams using various tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the relationship management module proposal.
- Implementation of the proposed architecture using selected tools.
