**🕒 03:50–04:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Smart Monitor System, GCP, Pub/Sub, Automation, Data Streams  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to organize and implement the setup of multiple publishers for the Smart Monitor System, ensuring all relevant data streams are published to [[Google Cloud]] Pub/Sub for further processing.

### Key Activities
- Organized the setup of publishers for the Smart Monitor System to manage data streams effectively.
- Outlined a structured approach to setting up publishers using [[Google Cloud]] Pub/Sub for various data sources, including email, Telegram, RSS, LinkedIn, and calendar updates.
- Switched GCP projects using the gcloud CLI and resumed the creation of Pub/Sub topics.
- Transitioned data ingestion bots to use GCP Pub/Sub subscriptions, replacing direct `listen()` methods to enhance scalability and efficiency.
- Implemented publishers to send data from email, Telegram, and RSS to [[Google Cloud]] Pub/Sub topics, with example scripts provided.
- Integrated email fetching logic with GCP Pub/Sub using [[Python]] and `imaplib` to publish email data.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up publishers for various data sources, enhancing the Smart Monitor System's ability to handle and process data streams efficiently.

### Pending Tasks
- Further integration and testing of the entire system to ensure seamless data flow and processing.
