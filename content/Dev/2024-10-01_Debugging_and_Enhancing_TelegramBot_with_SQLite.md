## 📅 2024-10-01 — Session: Debugging and Enhancing TelegramBot with SQLite

**🕒 00:10–02:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Telegrambot, Sqlite, Asynchronous, Debugging, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to debug and enhance the TelegramBot implementation by addressing database issues and improving asynchronous operations.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] Database Issues**: Analyzed and resolved database connection handling issues in the TelegramBot, comparing it with an Email bot, and implemented asynchronous database access using aiosqlite.
- **Fixing SQLite Table Creation**: Addressed an OperationalError in the TelegramBot due to a missing SQLite table, ensuring its asynchronous creation during bot initialization.
- **Asynchronous Test Fixes**: Improved handling of asynchronous tests by limiting message processing and ensuring graceful disconnection.
- **Preventing Infinite Loops**: Implemented a stopping condition in the message-fetching function to prevent infinite loops.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Asynchronous Execution**: Resolved event loop hangs and database table creation issues in the `fetch_last_day_messages()` function.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and enhanced the TelegramBot's database integration and asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth execution and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented solutions to ensure robustness in various scenarios.
