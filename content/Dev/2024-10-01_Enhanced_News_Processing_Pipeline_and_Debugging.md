### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the news processing pipeline by expanding content extraction, implementing unstructured data storage using MongoDB, integrating NLP for keyword extraction and classification, and automating the triage of news articles. Additionally, it focused on debugging and improving the `NewsDataCollector` bot.

### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive plan for enhancing the news scraping setup.
- Outlined and implemented the `NewsDataCollector` bot to scrape news from RSS feeds and store them in a SQLite database.
- Implemented verbose unit tests for the `NewsDataCollector` to ensure data integrity.
- Enhanced a [[Python]] function for news collection with verbose print statements for better debugging.
- Debugged issues related to news article storage, including database insertion errors and key mismatches.
- Revised the `save_to_db` method to ensure the news table exists before data insertion.

### Achievements
- Successfully planned and executed enhancements to the news processing pipeline.
- Implemented and tested the `NewsDataCollector` bot with improved error handling and logging.

### Pending Tasks
- Further integration of NLP features for keyword extraction and classification.
- Full automation of the news triage process.
