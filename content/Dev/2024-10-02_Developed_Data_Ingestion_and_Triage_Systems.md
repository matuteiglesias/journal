## 📅 2024-10-02 — Session: Developed Data Ingestion and Triage Systems

**🕒 03:30–04:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data ingestion, keyword extraction, classification, automation, SQLite  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a comprehensive data ingestion pipeline that integrates keyword extraction and classification to efficiently organize data from various sources, such as RSS feeds and emails, and route it to [[AI]] agents or databases.

### Key Activities
- Developed a `NewsDataCollector` for parsing news into a SQLite database.
- Planned and designed a triage system for data classification, integrating keyword extraction.
- Outlined an email processing system to detect new messages and perform triage for metadata extraction.
- Addressed a query timeout issue during email processing, suggesting alternative approaches for data loading.
- Provided [[Python]] code snippets for loading email data from a SQLite database into a [[Pandas]] DataFrame for further analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed the initial framework for a data ingestion pipeline with keyword extraction and classification capabilities.
- Designed a structured approach for a triage system to route data based on document types and keywords.

### Pending Tasks
- Enhance data handling workflows for the `NewsDataCollector`.
- Implement the designed triage system and email processing functionalities.
- Resolve query timeout issues with alternative data loading strategies.
