**üïí 14:30‚Äì17:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Automation, Python, Jupyter, Optimization, AI  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop an automated system that emulates human work in processing folders and analyzing files, optimizing the design using specific agents and memory analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Blueprint Creation:** Developed a framework for an automated system to process files and folders using [[AI]].
- **[[Optimization]] Strategies:** Explored the relationship between text length, space, and tokens to enhance system efficiency.
- **[[Python]] Scripting:** Created scripts for memory usage analysis of [[Python]] files and stripping outputs from [[Jupyter]] notebooks.
- **Directory Management:** Addressed issues related to directory access and file processing, including ignoring hidden files and handling encoding errors.
- **Token Estimation:** Estimated tokens required for processing submissions and strategized task management.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive system blueprint and optimization strategies.
- Successfully implemented [[Python]] scripts for file processing and memory usage analysis.
- Improved [[Jupyter]] notebook handling by automating output stripping and error management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of outliers in [[Jupyter]] notebook file sizes.
- Implementation of the folder processing loop design.
