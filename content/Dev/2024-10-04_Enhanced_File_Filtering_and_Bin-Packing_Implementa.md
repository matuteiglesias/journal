## 📅 2024-10-04 — Session: Enhanced File Filtering and Bin-Packing Implementation

**🕒 21:15–21:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, bin-packing, file management, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance a [[Python]] script for processing Jupyter Notebook files and implement a bin-packing algorithm for distributing consigna files.

### Key Activities
- Enhanced the file filtering capabilities of a Jupyter Notebook processing script by excluding checkpoint directories and handling Unicode errors.
- Developed a bin-packing algorithm using the First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) approach to distribute consignas efficiently without splitting them.
- Modified the bin-packing algorithm to balance the size and number of consignas in each chunk.
- Implemented a [[Python]] script to automate the retrieval and distribution of consigna notebooks into balanced chunks based on specified constraints.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the file filtering process to improve [[error handling]] and file management.
- Completed the implementation of a bin-packing algorithm to optimize consigna distribution.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the bin-packing algorithm under different scenarios.
- Documentation of the enhanced script and algorithm for future reference.
