### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to update and refine the [[Python]] script used for aggregating Jupyter notebooks by consigna, ensuring efficient processing without duplication and enhancing the debugging process.

### Key Activities
- Updated the [[Python]] script to aggregate responses from multiple groups into single notebooks for each consigna, removing the previous memory cap logic.
- Troubleshot duplication issues in the notebook processing script, ensuring proper segmentation by 'Consigna' markers.
- Added verbose logging to the `aggregate_and_save_consignas` function for better debugging.
- Outlined a plan for processing Jupyter notebooks, focusing on handling `_nout` versions to avoid duplication and capturing outputs.
- Refined the consigna splitting logic to improve boundary detection and metadata handling.
- Addressed a client-side exception error in the Diffchecker application related to '_nout.ipynb' files.
- Fixed notebook segmentation issues between Consigna 2 and 3.
- Created a new directory structure for group consignas, saving each as a separate Jupyter notebook file.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated the notebook aggregation script to handle consignas more effectively.
- Resolved duplication and segmentation issues, improving the overall processing logic.
- Enhanced the debugging capabilities with verbose logging.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated script in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring for any new issues that may arise with additional data inputs.
