### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop an email categorization system using [[machine learning]] techniques, focusing on natural language processing ([[NLP]]) and classification algorithms.

### Key Activities
- Planned the creation of a [[machine learning]]-based email categorization system using manually labeled examples as training data.
- Enhanced classifier performance by addressing dataset limitations, increasing training examples, balancing categories, and improving feature extraction methods.
- Extracted data from HTML files to prepare for [[machine learning]], focusing on subjects and content.
- Combined email features, such as subject lines and content, for a comprehensive input to the classification model.
- Extracted email data from HTML files and organized it into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

### Achievements
- Established a framework for email categorization using [[NLP]] and classification algorithms.
- Improved the dataset for better classifier performance.
- Successfully extracted and organized data from HTML files, ready for [[machine learning]] applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Confirm the correct directory path or upload the necessary files for [[data processing]].
