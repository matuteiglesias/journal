**üïí 00:00‚Äì00:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Machine Learning, Python, Model Evaluation, DataFrame, Classifier  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address issues related to [[machine learning]] model evaluation and improvement, specifically focusing on handling input errors, classifier performance analysis, and improving email classification models.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing CountVectorizer Input Error:** Implemented a solution to combine multiple DataFrame columns into a single text input for vectorization using CountVectorizer.
- **Classifier Performance Analysis:** Analyzed classifier performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and provided recommendations for accuracy and precision improvements.
- **Identifying Misclassified Cases:** Developed a [[Python]] script to identify misclassified cases by comparing predicted labels with true labels.
- **Handling Sparse Matrices:** Corrected handling of sparse matrices during the train-test split to maintain indexes for effective identification of misclassified samples.
- **Improving Email Classification Model:** Proposed strategies for improving email classification, including TF-IDF vectorization, n-grams, feature engineering, and utilizing a multi-layer model approach.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the CountVectorizer input error.
- Provided actionable insights for classifier performance improvement.
- Identified misclassified cases effectively using a [[Python]] script.
- Enhanced handling of sparse matrices in [[machine learning]] workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed strategies for improving the email classification model.
