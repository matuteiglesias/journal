## 📅 2024-10-21 — Session: GeoJSON Data Processing and Visualization

**🕒 21:55–22:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Geojson, Python, Data Visualization, Geopandas, Matplotlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to process and visualize geospatial data using [[Python]] libraries, focusing on GeoJSON files related to villages.

### Key Activities
- An overview of GeoJSON files in the villages directory was provided, setting the context for the data processing tasks.
- A [[Python]] script was introduced to preview non-geometry data from GeoJSON files, facilitating quick data inspection.
- A relational schema was proposed to integrate various datasets, detailing the structure and relationships among tables.
- A step-by-step guide for data aggregation and visualization using [[Python]] was outlined, leveraging libraries like Geopandas and [[Matplotlib]].
- An error related to the `markersize` parameter in [[Matplotlib]] was resolved, ensuring proper visualization of grouped data.
- Solutions for handling non-numeric data in GeoDataFrames and addressing empty DataFrames in geo-data visualization were provided.

### Achievements
- Successfully inspected and processed GeoJSON files for non-geometry data.
- Developed a comprehensive relational schema for dataset integration.
- Implemented data aggregation and visualization strategies, resolving key errors in data handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of data visualization scripts to enhance robustness and error handling.
- Exploration of additional datasets for comprehensive mapping and analysis.
