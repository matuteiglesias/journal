**üïí 21:55‚Äì22:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: GeoJSON, Python, Data Visualization, GeoPandas, Matplotlib  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to process and visualize geospatial data using [[Python]] libraries, focusing on GeoJSON files related to villages.

### Key Activities
- An overview of GeoJSON files in the villages directory was provided, setting the context for the [[data processing]] tasks.
- A [[Python]] script was introduced to preview non-geometry data from GeoJSON files, facilitating quick data inspection.
- A relational schema was proposed to integrate various datasets, detailing the structure and relationships among tables.
- A step-by-step guide for data aggregation and visualization using [[Python]] was outlined, leveraging libraries like Geopandas and [[Matplotlib]].
- An error related to the `markersize` parameter in [[Matplotlib]] was resolved, ensuring proper visualization of grouped data.
- Solutions for handling non-numeric data in GeoDataFrames and addressing empty DataFrames in geo-[[data visualization]] were provided.

### Achievements
- Successfully inspected and processed GeoJSON files for non-geometry data.
- Developed a comprehensive relational schema for dataset integration.
- Implemented data aggregation and visualization strategies, resolving key errors in data handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of [[data visualization]] scripts to enhance robustness and [[error handling]].
- Exploration of additional datasets for comprehensive mapping and analysis.
