## 📅 2024-10-26 — Session: Database and Task Scheduling Design

**🕒 19:45–20:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: database, scheduling, task management, Python, OR-Tools, virtual environment  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to design a database structure for a scheduling tool and refine task scheduling processes.

### Key Activities
- **Database Structure:** Developed a database schema using DBML for a scheduling tool, outlining tables for tasks, time blocks, constraints, and user preferences.
- **[[CSV]] Output:** Created structured [[CSV]] representations for 'constraints' and 'user_preferences' tables.
- **Task Management Constraints:** Designed a constraints table to optimize task scheduling and [[productivity]].
- **OR-Tools Installation:** Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` for OR-Tools and addressed compatibility issues with `protobuf`.
- **Virtual Environment Setup:** Guided the setup of a clean [[Python]] virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive database framework for scheduling tools.
- Developed clear [[CSV]] templates for database tables.
- Enhanced task scheduling with refined constraints tables.
- Successfully resolved installation and compatibility issues for OR-Tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the database structure and task scheduling logic in practical scenarios.
- Continuous monitoring for any emerging compatibility issues with [[Python]] packages.
