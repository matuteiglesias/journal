## 📅 2024-10-27 — Session: Enhanced Task Scheduling with Dynamic Constraints

**🕒 17:40–18:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: task scheduling, dynamic constraints, Python, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the task scheduling system by implementing dynamic time constraints.

### Key Activities
- Introduced a 'timing' column in a constraints [[CSV]] to allow precise application of start and end constraints for tasks.
- Updated [[Python]] code to enforce time constraints for Gym scheduling, ensuring tasks start after 7 PM.
- Implemented dynamic adjustments to time constraints based on the day of the week, particularly for the 'Gym' task.
- Developed a method to dynamically calculate the day for task instances, ensuring accurate constraint application.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated the task scheduling system to handle dynamic time constraints.
- Ensured that the Gym task adheres to its start time constraint across all instances.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the dynamic scheduling system to ensure robustness across all task types.
