## 📅 2024-11-03 — Session: Data Processing and Algorithm Implementation

**🕒 22:30–23:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Processing, Python, Greedy Algorithm, Dataset Filtering, Json Manipulation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data processing capabilities and implement algorithms for efficient data management and student course selection.

### Key Activities
- Filtered a dataset to retain records with individuals having more than one exam entry, focusing on those with at least two exam records.
- Implemented a greedy algorithm for course selection based on unique contributions to student coverage, including [[Python]] code for practical application.
- Converted [[JSON]]-like strings to [[Python]] dictionaries with sets for efficient data manipulation.
- Improved [[JSON]] output from pandas DataFrame to represent `id` fields as sets, enhancing data operations.
- Filtered courses labeled 'LCD' to facilitate a greedy iteration process for maximizing student coverage.

### Achievements
- Successfully filtered datasets for specific criteria.
- Developed and demonstrated a greedy algorithm for course selection.
- Enhanced data manipulation techniques using [[Python]] and pandas.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the greedy algorithm for larger datasets.
- Exploration of additional data processing techniques to improve efficiency.
