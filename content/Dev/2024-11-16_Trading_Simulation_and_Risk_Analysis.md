**🕒 19:15–20:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Trading, Risk Management, Data Visualization, Simulation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and analyze a [[Python]] simulation tool for modeling trading account performance, focusing on risk management and trading strategies.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] simulation tool to model trading performance with customizable parameters such as win rate, gain-to-loss ratio, and risk per trade.
- Analyzed trading simulation outcomes, highlighting key statistics and implications for decision-making.
- Conducted a structured analysis of the simulation code, focusing on risk management strategies.
- Reviewed simulation results on risk and mean final balance, providing recommendations for optimal risk management.
- Analyzed risk-reward dynamics in trading strategies, emphasizing discipline and the balance between win rate and gain-to-loss ratio.
- Examined box plot distributions by risk levels to understand the impact on median outcomes and variability.
- Enhanced [[data visualization]] using Seaborn to improve clarity and aesthetics.
- Presented a DataFrame illustrating exponential growth and insights on compounding.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and analyzed a trading simulation tool.
- Provided insights into risk management and trading strategies.
- Improved [[data visualization]] techniques for better clarity and understanding.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the simulation tool for additional parameters and scenarios.
- Explore advanced visualization techniques to enhance data presentation.
