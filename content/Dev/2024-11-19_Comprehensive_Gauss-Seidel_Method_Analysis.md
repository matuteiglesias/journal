## 📅 2024-11-19 — Session: Comprehensive Gauss-Seidel Method Analysis

**🕒 15:50–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Gauss-Seidel, numerical methods, convergence, accounting, property management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to analyze and improve the Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear equations, focusing on convergence issues and implementation errors.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a separate accounting system for property management to ensure transparency and financial planning.
- Detailed the structure of co-ownership agreements, including roles, dividend plans, and financial models.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Gauss-Seidel method, including:
  - Calculation of the spectral radius for iteration matrices.
  - Evaluation of convergence conditions and identification of implementation errors.
  - Execution of the Gauss-Seidel method with detailed explanations and error analysis.
  - Improved the method's implementation in [[Python]], focusing on error checking and iteration consistency.

### Achievements
- Developed a guide for implementing separate accounting for property management.
- Created a template for co-ownership agreements.
- Identified and corrected errors in the Gauss-Seidel method implementation, enhancing its accuracy and reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of the Gauss-Seidel method's convergence with different initial vectors.
- Validation of calculations and simplification of the problem for better understanding.
