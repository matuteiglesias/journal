## 📅 2024-12-01 — Session: Enhanced Email Ingestion and Database Schema Update

**🕒 16:30–17:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Email Ingestion, Database Schema, Python, Automation, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to enhance the email ingestion process by integrating Gmail labels and updating the database schema to store these labels along with email sizes.

### Key Activities
- Verified the file path for the 'messages.db' database to ensure accessibility.
- Modified the email ingestion script to include Gmail labels using the X-GM-LABELS extension.
- Updated the database schema to store email labels and sizes in KB, with the necessary SQL commands and [[Python]] code.
- Troubleshot access issues with the database file, verifying file path, existence, and permissions.
- Developed a strategy for improved email parsing, focusing on extracting message IDs and labels.
- Debugged and corrected errors in the `mail.fetch` command and the `cursor.execute` method in [[Python]].
- Enhanced the email parsing code to filter out unnecessary metadata and focus on relevant custom labels.
- Provided a [[Python]] script for debugging email label extraction logic.
- Outlined a framework for annotating emails to train a tailored agent.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated Gmail labels into the email ingestion process.
- Updated the database schema to accommodate new email attributes.
- Improved the email parsing logic to ensure cleaner data extraction.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated email ingestion and parsing scripts in a production environment.
- Implementation of the structured annotation framework for the email dataset.
