## üìÖ 2024-12-02 ‚Äî Session: Email Ingestion and MongoDB Integration

**üïí 00:00‚Äì01:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Email Ingestion, Mongodb, Automation, Scheduling, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to enhance the email ingestion pipeline by scheduling the `email_ingestor.py` script, improving its modularity, and resolving MongoDB connection issues.

### Key Activities
- **Task Scheduling**: Scheduled `email_ingestor.py` using `scheduler.py`, enhancing task modularity and logging.
- **MongoDB [[Troubleshooting]]**: Resolved connection issues, started MongoDB service, and installed `mongosh`.
- **[[Data Management]]**: Verified email ingestion scheduler, managed subject fields, and implemented deduplication logic.
- **Processing Layer [[Development]]**: Built a processing layer with Jupyter notebooks for email classification and management.
- **Tool [[Integration]]**: Refactored `classifier.py` to use OpenAI's SDK for improved email classification.

### Achievements
- Successfully scheduled and automated email ingestion.
- Resolved MongoDB connection and startup warnings.
- Implemented deduplication logic in the ingestion script.
- Developed a robust processing layer for email data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the processing layer and deduplication logic.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of the ingestion pipeline.
