### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the email automation pipeline by integrating RabbitMQ for workflow management and improving the Smart Gatekeeper Agent for email classification.

### Key Activities
- Implemented middle layers in the email automation pipeline, focusing on task enrichment, event parsing, and routing logic.
- Integrated RabbitMQ into the system for orchestrating workflows, including queue design, setup instructions, and testing procedures.
- Developed a structured approach to integrate processed emails with RabbitMQ and addressed RabbitMQ connection issues.
- Enhanced the Smart Gatekeeper Agent with improved email classification and metadata extraction capabilities.
- Explored options for creating UIs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB management, and identified lightweight alternatives to MongoDB Compass.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated RabbitMQ with the email processing system, improving workflow orchestration and task management.
- Enhanced the Smart Gatekeeper Agent, resulting in more efficient email classification and processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development of user interfaces for RabbitMQ and MongoDB management.
- Continued refinement of middle-layer agent schemas and integration processes.
