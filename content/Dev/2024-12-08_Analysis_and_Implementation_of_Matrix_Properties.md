## 📅 2024-12-08 — Session: Analysis and Implementation of Matrix Properties

**🕒 14:55–15:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Matrix Analysis, Sympy, Eigenvalues, Convergence, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze the convergence of iterative methods and implement checks for matrix properties using symbolic computation.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed convergence conditions for Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods.
- Developed a plan to implement diagonal dominance and positive definiteness checks in SymPy.
- Evaluated matrix conditions such as diagonal dominance and positive definiteness.
- Retried computations for characteristic polynomial and eigenvalues due to execution errors.
- Initialized a screening agent for message organization.

### Achievements
- Outlined necessary conditions for convergence of iterative methods.
- Implemented and debugged checks for matrix properties in SymPy.
- Computed characteristic polynomial and eigenvalues of matrix A.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of positive definiteness and numerical evaluation of eigenvalues.
