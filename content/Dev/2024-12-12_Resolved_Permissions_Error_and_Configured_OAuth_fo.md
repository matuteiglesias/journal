### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve a permissions error for a [[Google Cloud]] service account and configure OAuth integration for n8n with Gmail.

### Key Activities
- **Resolved Permissions Error:** Addressed a permissions error for the service account `media-monitor-tool@appspot.gserviceaccount.com` during App Engine deployment by granting necessary storage permissions and verifying project settings.
- **OAuth [[Integration]] for n8n:** Configured OAuth flow from n8n to Gmail, including updates to the OAuth consent screen and credentials.
- **Set Up OAuth Redirect URI:** Configured the redirect URI in [[Google Cloud]] Console for OAuth 2.0 and tested in n8n.
- **Configured OAuth2 for Gmail in n8n:** Set up OAuth2 authentication for Gmail, including credential management and scopes setup.
- **Streamlined OAuth Flows:** Explored options for integrating OAuth flows with n8n, using App Engine as a redirect URI and deploying n8n to App Engine for a cloud-hosted solution.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the permissions error and completed the OAuth configuration for n8n, enabling seamless integration with Gmail.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the OAuth integration in a production environment to ensure stability and performance.
