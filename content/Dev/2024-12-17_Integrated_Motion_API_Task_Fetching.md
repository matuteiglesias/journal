**🕒 17:15–19:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Api Integration, Python, Task Management, Automation, Workflow  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to integrate task fetching from the Motion [[API]] into a structured workflow, enhancing task management and automation processes.

### Key Activities
- Utilized the Motion App [[API]]'s 'List Tasks' endpoint to retrieve tasks.
- Developed [[Python]] code for fetching tasks, processing [[JSON]] responses into [[Pandas]] DataFrames, and managing pagination.
- Resolved 'InvalidStateError' in VS Code by clearing cache and updating extensions.
- Implemented [[API]] rate limit management by introducing a delay between calls.
- Updated code for column presence checks to improve robustness.
- Integrated the task-fetching script with scheduled workflows for roles like Chief of Staff and Task Manager.
- Developed workflows for actionable insights and briefings, focusing on task filtering and synchronization.

### Achievements
- Successfully fetched and processed tasks from the Motion [[API]].
- Improved error handling and data validation in the [[Python]] script.
- Established a structured workflow for integrating task fetching with automation tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize [[API]] call efficiency and explore server-side filtering options.
- Continue enhancing the integration of task management workflows.
