### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to automate the analysis of directory sizes and plan for the migration of large data directories to external media.

### Key Activities
1. **Bash Command for Directory Analysis**: Utilized a Bash command to list the largest directories at level 2, providing insights into directory sizes.
2. **Automated Script Creation**: Developed a Bash script to automate the analysis of specified directories, listing the top 5 largest subdirectories by size.
3. **Migration Planning**: Outlined a systematic approach for migrating large data directories to external media, ensuring data integrity and space management.
4. **Execution of Migration Plan**: Created a checklist for migrating non-repository directories, including steps for verifying space, copying data, and ensuring integrity.
5. **Verification with `diff -r`**: Used the `diff -r` command to verify directory copies, ensuring identical content post-migration.

### Achievements
- Successfully automated the directory size analysis and planned a comprehensive migration strategy.
- Developed scripts and checklists to facilitate efficient data management and migration processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Execute the migration plan for all identified directories.
- Continuously monitor and verify data integrity post-migration.
