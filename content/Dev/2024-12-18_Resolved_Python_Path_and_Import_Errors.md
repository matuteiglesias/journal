## 📅 2024-12-18 — Session: Resolved Python Path and Import Errors

**🕒 20:35–21:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pathlib, Error Handling, Environment Setup, Logging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to address and resolve various errors and issues related to [[Python]]'s `pathlib` library and import management in a [[Python]] project.

### Key Activities
- Implemented detailed logging for handling GPT prompts, ensuring error visibility.
- Debugged and resolved the 'type object 'Path' has no attribute 'home'' error.
- Identified and fixed logging errors and TypeErrors in logger calls.
- Addressed circular imports caused by modifications to the `pathlib` library.
- Resolved missing `is_mount` and `readlink` attributes in the `Path` class.
- Diagnosed and fixed conflicts between custom `Path` classes and standard `pathlib.Path`.
- Cleaned up `pkg_resources` and vendor files to prevent environment conflicts.
- Set up a new [[Python]] environment to resolve persistent issues.
- Developed a consistent imports plan and optimized project structure with a `requirements.txt` file.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple path-related errors and import issues.
- Established a new, clean [[Python]] environment.
- Developed a structured approach for imports and environment setup.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of temporary fixes for missing `Path` attributes.
- Long-term monitoring of logging implementations and environment stability.
