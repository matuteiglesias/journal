## 📅 2024-12-22 — Session: Refinement of Regex for Installment Data Parsing

**🕒 22:15–22:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Regex, Data Parsing, Debugging, Cuota, Importe  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to refine the regex logic used for parsing 'Cuota' (installment) details in financial data, ensuring accurate separation and data integrity.

### Key Activities
- Identified issues with the existing regex patterns that were causing incorrect data separation and misalignment in 'Cuota' and 'Importe' fields.
- Proposed and implemented improvements to the regex logic to enhance data extraction accuracy.
- Debugged and tested the refined function to ensure correct parsing of installment details into distinct columns while maintaining data integrity.
- Addressed variable initialization errors and directory path issues related to PDF parsing.
- Successfully parsed financial data lines, extracting key fields such as date, code, description, current installment, total installments, amount, and currency.

### Achievements
- Improved the accuracy of data parsing for financial documents by refining regex patterns.
- Resolved errors related to variable initialization and directory paths, ensuring smoother execution of parsing functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated parsing logic to ensure robustness across diverse datasets.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of regex patterns as needed to handle varying data formats.
