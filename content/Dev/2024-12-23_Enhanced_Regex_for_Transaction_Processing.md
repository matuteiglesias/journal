### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the regex patterns used in transaction processing to handle various cases such as negative amounts, specific transaction types, and diverse date formats.

### Key Activities
- **Regex Update for Transaction Amounts**: Improved the regex pattern to handle both positive and negative transaction amounts effectively.
- **Regex Update for SU PAGO Detection**: Modified regex to include 'SU PAGO' lines in transaction parsing, ensuring comprehensive detection.
- **Robust Date Parsing**: Developed regex patterns to handle dates with optional spaces and single-digit days, ensuring robust transaction date parsing.

### Achievements
