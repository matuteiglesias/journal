**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the email processing system by addressing various [[debugging]] issues, improving logging, and refining the classification process.

### Key Activities
- **Project Overview**: Reviewed the architecture and objectives of the intelligent email ingestion and processing project.
- **Documentation Strategy**: Developed a rapid [[documentation]] creation [[strategy]] using [[automation]] tools.
- **[[Debugging]]**: Conducted root cause analysis and [[debugging]] of email reprocessing issues in the gatekeeper system.
- **Logging Enhancements**: Improved logging and [[error handling]] in microservices.
- **Function Updates**: Modified functions to handle reclassification and reprocessing of emails.
- **[[API]] [[Integration]]**: Resolved issues with deprecated [[OpenAI]] [[API]] usage and fixed [[API]] key retrieval problems.
- **Workflow Analysis**: Analyzed and updated the email processing pipeline and triage agents' performance.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented enhancements to the email processing [[workflow]], including improved logging and [[error handling]].
- Updated classification functions to dynamically reclassify emails with empty categories.
- Resolved [[API]] integration issues, ensuring proper configuration and usage.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize the email classification system for more consistent category naming and enhanced metadata enrichment.
- Continue monitoring and refining the [[debugging]] processes in the email processing pipeline.
