**üïí 14:50‚Äì15:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: MongoDB, Python, Data Processing, Debugging, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance MongoDB [[data processing]] capabilities and address existing issues in database operations and data integrity.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script to connect to MongoDB and reveal collection keys, aiding in understanding email ingestion data structure.
- Drafted a script to retrieve documents from MongoDB collections, focusing on key extraction without value exposure.
- Introduced a `processed_at` timestamp field in job, task, and event processing scripts for better consistency and [[debugging]].
- Addressed serialization and classification issues in message processing, providing actionable solutions.
- Outlined best practices for MongoDB document insertion, emphasizing correct serialization of `_id` fields.
- Provided a [[Python]] snippet for inspecting MongoDB records by ID.
- Debugged issues related to `raw_message_id` in MongoDB queries, focusing on data integrity and logging.

### Achievements
- Enhanced understanding of MongoDB data structures and improved [[data processing]] scripts.
- Implemented a new timestamp field for better data tracking and [[debugging]].
- Resolved key serialization and classification issues, improving data accuracy.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new `processed_at` field across all processing scripts.
- Continuous monitoring and [[debugging]] of MongoDB operations to ensure data integrity.
