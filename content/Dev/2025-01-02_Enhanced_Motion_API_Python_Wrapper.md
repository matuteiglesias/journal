### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and enhance a [[Python]] wrapper for the Motion [[API]], focusing on [[task management]], project creation, and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- Implemented a [[Python]] wrapper for the Motion [[API]], including class definitions and utility functions for [[task management]], project creation, and bulk updates.
- Enhanced the `MotionHandler` class with methods for creating projects and tasks, associating tasks with projects, and updating tasks using Motion's REST [[API]].
- Refined the `create_project` function, adding a main execution block for testing and verification.
- Integrated [[API]] key loading from a YAML configuration file into the [[Python]] script, including [[error handling]] using the PyYAML library.
- Resolved YAML parsing errors by addressing formatting issues and improving [[debugging]] and testing processes.
- Fixed a `400 Bad Request` error in the `create_project` function by ensuring all required fields were included and revising the function implementation.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a robust [[Python]] wrapper for the Motion [[API]] with enhanced functionality for project and [[task management]].
- Improved [[error handling]] and configuration management through YAML integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the `create_project` function and the overall Motion [[API]] wrapper to ensure reliability and performance.
