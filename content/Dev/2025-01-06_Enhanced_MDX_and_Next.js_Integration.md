## 📅 2025-01-06 — Session: Enhanced MDX and Next.js Integration

**🕒 15:15–16:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: MDX, Next.js, getStaticProps, React, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the integration of MDX files within a Next.js application, focusing on rendering components, data fetching, and layout management.

### Key Activities
- Implemented rendering of `<RepoCards>` directly within `page.mdx` files to allow independent repository display.
- Utilized `getStaticProps` in Next.js for data fetching, resolving issues with using `await` at the top level in `.mdx` or `.js` files.
- Addressed compatibility issues between `.mdx` files and `getStaticProps` by employing a wrapper `.js` or `.tsx` file.
- Developed a guide for reading [[CSV]] files in Next.js to populate `<RepoCards />` components using `getStaticProps`.
- Managed repository data filtering directly within individual pages, enabling autonomy without a global wrapper.
- Resolved MDX layout issues by separating logic and content into distinct files for better compliance with Next.js rules.
- Automated the insertion of [[JSON]] snippets into MDX files using a bash script to enhance [[workflow]] efficiency.
- Planned a template-driven approach for generating `.mdx` files using [[Python]] scripting.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated MDX components and data fetching strategies in Next.js.
- Improved [[workflow]] efficiency with [[automation]] scripts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the template-driven approach for `.mdx` file generation.
