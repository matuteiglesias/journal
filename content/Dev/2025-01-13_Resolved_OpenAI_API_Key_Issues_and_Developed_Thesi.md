**üïí 09:30‚Äì11:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: OpenAI, API, Thesis Management, Clustering, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve [[OpenAI]] [[API]] key recognition issues and develop a comprehensive [[workflow]] for thesis management using clustering and summarization techniques.

### Key Activities
1. **Resolved [[OpenAI]] [[API]] Key Issues**: Troubleshot and resolved issues related to the [[OpenAI]] [[API]] key not being recognized by the library. This included setting the key explicitly, using environment variables, and verifying installations.
2. **Developed Thesis Management Workflow**: Created a structured approach to manage thesis content through recursive embedding, clustering, and summarization techniques. This involved adapting data ingestion processes for efficient content retrieval and management.
3. **Updated Code for Document Processing**: Provided updated [[Python]] code for processing text files, including token counting and histogram visualization.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[API]] key recognition issues, ensuring seamless integration with the [[OpenAI]] library.
- Developed a robust [[workflow]] for thesis management, enabling systematic organization and analysis of thesis sections.
- Enhanced document processing capabilities with updated [[Python]] code.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the thesis management [[workflow]] by incorporating additional [[data processing]] techniques.
- Explore additional blog series ideas based on thesis insights.

### Session Timing
- **Start Time**: 09:30
- **End Time**: 11:30
