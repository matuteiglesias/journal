## 📅 2025-01-26 — Session: Developed RabbitMQ Monitoring Dashboard with Flask

**🕒 22:20–23:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Rabbitmq, Flask, Dashboard, Web Development, Mongodb  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement a real-time monitoring dashboard for RabbitMQ queues, inspired by Linux Dash, using [[Flask]] for the backend and JavaScript/[[HTML]] for the frontend.

### Key Activities
- **Dashboard Planning and Design**: Initial plans were laid out for a lightweight RabbitMQ dashboard, focusing on frontend and backend integration.
- **[[Flask]] Application Development**: Implemented a [[Flask]] app to manage RabbitMQ and MongoDB, including endpoints for displaying queue counts and managing MongoDB collections.
- **Error Fixes and Enhancements**: Addressed a `404 Not Found` error by defining a root route and added an endpoint to serve `index.html`.
- **Frontend and Backend [[Integration]]**: Made MongoDB collections clickable in the frontend, updated the backend for data processing, and redesigned the frontend table structure.
- **Data Handling Improvements**: Enhanced the display of RabbitMQ messages in a structured table format, implemented dynamic [[JSON]] parsing, and ensured proper data rendering.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a functional dashboard using [[Flask]] and JavaScript, capable of monitoring RabbitMQ queues and managing MongoDB collections.
- Improved data processing and display techniques, ensuring robust handling of various message formats.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the frontend table design to optimize user interaction and data visualization.
- Consider additional features for real-time data updates and alerts.
