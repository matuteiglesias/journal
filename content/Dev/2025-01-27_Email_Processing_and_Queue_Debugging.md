**üïí 11:10‚Äì12:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Email Processing, Rabbitmq, Debugging, Schema, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the email processing workflow and address issues related to [[JSON]] parsing in RabbitMQ messages.

### Key Activities
- **Email Processing Flow Structure**: Refined the workflow for processing emails from ingestion to final integration.
- **[[Debugging]] [[JSON]] Parsing**: Enhanced the function for debugging [[JSON]] parsing in RabbitMQ queues with additional logging.
- **Fixing [[JSON]] Parsing Issues**: Implemented a solution for improperly formatted [[JSON]] messages from RabbitMQ, including preprocessing and normalization into a DataFrame.
- **[[Debugging]] HTML Issues**: Addressed missing queue buttons in HTML with frontend and backend updates.
- **Queue Data Structures [[Debugging]]**: Developed a systematic approach for debugging queue data structures.
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzed logs for task, knowledge, and job posting queues, identifying causes of parsing failures.
- **Enqueue Message Function Improvements**: Enhanced the RabbitMQ message queuing function with better serialization and error handling.
- **Email Processing Checklist**: Created a comprehensive checklist for monitoring and debugging the email processing system.
- **Schema Exploration and Definition**: Explored and defined schemas for various email processing collections in MongoDB.

### Achievements
- Improved email processing logic and workflow structure.
- Enhanced debugging capabilities for [[JSON]] parsing in RabbitMQ.
- Defined and refined database schemas for email processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated email processing logic and RabbitMQ debugging enhancements.
- Implementation of recommendations from log analysis to improve error handling.
