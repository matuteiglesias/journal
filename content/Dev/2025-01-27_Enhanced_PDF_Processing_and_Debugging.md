## üìÖ 2025-01-27 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced PDF Processing and Debugging

**üïí 23:00‚Äì23:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Pdf Processing, Automation, Debugging, Python, Modular Design  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the PDF processing pipeline by implementing modular workflows, automatic folder naming, and robust debugging processes.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script for processing PDF files into overlapping text chunks, with functions for refining text and saving output files.
- Updated the script to automatically name output folders based on the PDF file's name, improving organization.
- Outlined a modular workflow for PDF and text chunk processing, including context loading and vector store building.
- Created a structured plan for incremental improvements in a RAG app, focusing on modular design and error handling.
- Provided a comprehensive debugging guide for vectorstore initialization and HTML interaction with the `/query` endpoint.
- Debugged issues related to PDF chunking and fallback processing, ensuring correct execution of processing functions.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented modular PDF processing workflows.
- Enhanced the organization of output files through automatic folder naming.
- Improved the robustness of the RAG app with a focus on error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the PDF processing pipeline.
- Continued improvements on the RAG app's modular design and error handling capabilities.
