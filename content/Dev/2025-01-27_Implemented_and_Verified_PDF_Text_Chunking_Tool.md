## 📅 2025-01-27 — Session: Implemented and Verified PDF Text Chunking Tool

**🕒 21:40–22:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: PDF Processing, Python, Automation, Text Chunking  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement a tool for processing PDF files by extracting text, chunking it into manageable pieces, and saving the results as text files.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a [[Python]] script using PyPDF2 and nltk for extracting and chunking text from PDF files.
- Successfully processed a PDF file, generating and saving chunk files in the specified directory.
- Verified the success of the PDF chunking process, confirming the generation of a chunk file named 'chunk_1.txt'.
- Identified and planned adjustments for overly aggressive content splitting to improve sentence or paragraph preservation.
- Addressed missing variable handling by proposing re-importing and extracting text with adjusted logic.

### Achievements
- Completed the implementation and verification of the PDF text chunking tool.
- Successfully generated and saved chunk files for further review or download.

### Pending Tasks
- Adjust the chunking logic to better preserve sentences or paragraphs while maintaining manageable chunk sizes.
