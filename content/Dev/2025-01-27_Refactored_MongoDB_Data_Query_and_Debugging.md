### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to refine and debug MongoDB queries, ensuring accurate data retrieval and processing.

### Key Activities
- Queried the last inserted tasks in MongoDB using [[Python]] and pymongo, focusing on sorting and limiting results.
- Checked document existence in MongoDB collections with updated methods to avoid deprecated functions.
- Diagnosed missing fields in MongoDB collections, identifying reasons for `None` values and proposing diagnostic steps.
- Debugged schema mismatches in `task_processed_emails` collection, addressing data ingestion and query logic issues.
- Refined query logic for `processed_at` timestamps to ensure correct retrieval of recent entries.
- Resolved sorting issues in MongoDB queries, focusing on the `processed_at` field.
- Updated [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint to sort documents by `processed_at`, ensuring the most recent records are fetched.
- Reflected on job execution and data processing insights, integrating Google Sheets with MongoDB and highlighting warnings and improvements.

### Achievements
- Improved data retrieval accuracy by addressing sorting and schema issues in MongoDB.
- Enhanced the [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint for better document sorting.
- Identified and proposed solutions for missing field issues in data processing workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated [[Flask]] [[API]] endpoint in production.
- Continuous monitoring of MongoDB queries to ensure ongoing accuracy and performance.
