### Session Goal
The session aimed to conceptualize and plan a modular [[AI]] [[workflow]] framework and explore enhancements for the RAG Mastery Prototype.

### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive framework for modular knowledge workflows, detailing components for inputs, prompts, outputs, and UI/UX concepts.
- Explored off-the-shelf solutions for building modular [[AI]]-driven systems, including [[workflow]] [[automation]] and prompt orchestration.
- Proposed a unique product opportunity combining modular [[AI]] workflows with drag-and-drop UI and integration with various data sources.
- Planned enhancements for the RAG Mastery Prototype UI, focusing on UI improvements, prompt pipeline features, and backend enhancements.
- Outlined the frontend architecture for ChatGPT and similar applications, emphasizing key technologies and design principles.
- Detailed the team structure needed for launching a market-competitive product, emphasizing project lead responsibilities and team roles.
- Described a project for developing a modular [[AI]] [[workflow]] platform with configurable workflows and [[automation]] features.
- Highlighted the strengths of Emiliano Spinella in product management and platform development.
- Presented an improved HTML template for the RAG Mastery project using modern design principles.
- Designed the architecture for a 'Box of Context' system for file uploads, detailing backend and frontend functionalities.
- Implemented a [[Flask]] backend for the 'Box of Context' system, providing setup and code details.
- Debugged file upload issues in [[Flask]] and [[JavaScript]], providing a systematic troubleshooting approach.

### Achievements
- Conceptualized a modular [[AI]] [[workflow]] framework with potential product opportunities.
- Enhanced the RAG Mastery Prototype UI and tech stack.
- Improved understanding of frontend architecture and team roles for product launch.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development and testing of the modular [[AI]] [[workflow]] platform.
- Implementation of proposed UI enhancements for the RAG Mastery Prototype.
- Continued [[debugging]] and [[optimization]] of the 'Box of Context' system.
