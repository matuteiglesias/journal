### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to integrate Supabase buckets with n8n workflows to automate data processing tasks and optimize workflow efficiency.

### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive approach for integrating Supabase buckets with n8n workflows, including setup, management, and automation.
- Streamlined Supabase workflows in both local and web environments, covering account verification, storage management, and embedding integration.
- Configured and tested n8n workflows for file management and processing, including verifying bucket contents and debugging common issues.
- Debugged the 'Download' node in n8n workflows, focusing on URL verification and authentication.
- Managed files in Supabase storage, including operations like fetching metadata and setting up workflows for text extraction and vectorization.
- Resolved a `NOT NULL` constraint issue in Supabase and integrated vector embeddings using PostgreSQL's `pgvector` extension.
- Adjusted PostgreSQL table schema for UUID usage and integrated a chat agent with Supabase vector store.
- Troubleshot Supabase [[API]] calls for file retrieval and configured the Download Node for file access.
- Clarified Supabase storage endpoints and resolved 'Bucket not found' and 404 errors.
- Addressed duplicate key errors and context integration issues in [[AI]] workflows.
- Fixed the `match_documents` function in PostgreSQL and resolved type mismatch errors.
- Troubleshot PostgREST function visibility and resolved related errors.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated Supabase with n8n workflows, enhancing data processing automation.
- Optimized Supabase workflows and resolved multiple debugging issues.
- Improved database schema and integrated advanced features like vector embeddings.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the integrated workflows to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of workflow performance.
