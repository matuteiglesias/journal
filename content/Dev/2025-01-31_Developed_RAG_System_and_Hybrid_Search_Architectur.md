### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding and plan for implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and a hybrid search architecture.

### Key Activities
- Created a structured study plan for LangChain, Chroma, [[OpenAI]], and LlamaIndex.
- Developed a guide for building a RAG system with automated workflows, including file ingestion, chunking, embedding, and UI design.
- Explored various products and services for RAG pipelines, focusing on [[data processing]] and embedding.
- Analyzed the `rag/app` section of the RAGFlow repository, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential enhancements.
- Evaluated RAGFlow guides for knowledge base management and file management [[automation]].
- Proposed an architecture for a hybrid search system using LangChain, RAGFlow, Elasticsearch, Chroma, and Pinecone.
- Outlined a 3-day project plan for implementing a hybrid RAG system.

### Achievements
- Established a clear roadmap and implementation guide for RAG systems and hybrid search architecture.
- Identified key tools and workflows necessary for successful implementation.

### Pending Tasks
- Execute the 3-day project plan for the hybrid RAG system.
- Further refine the hybrid search architecture based on initial implementation feedback.
