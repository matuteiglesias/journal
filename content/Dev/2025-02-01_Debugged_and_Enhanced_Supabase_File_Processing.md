## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Debugged and Enhanced Supabase File Processing

**🕒 02:45–03:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Supabase, Python, Debugging, File Processing, Metadata  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to debug and enhance the file processing and metadata management system using [[Python]] and Supabase.

### Key Activities
- Debugged a 404 error for Supabase documents table by checking endpoint validity, column names, and insert operations.
- Aligned metadata structure between the `files` table and `process_book` function, updating UUID handling and field initialization.
- Implemented a [[Python]] script for aggregated metadata collection, saving into a single [[JSON]] file with improved error handling.
- Revised `process_book` and `process_books_dir` functions to separate metadata collections for files and chunks.
- Updated [[Python]] code for book processing to ensure alignment with the database schema.
- Developed a function for uploading files and chunks to Supabase with error handling.
- Corrected [[Python]] code for iterating over chunks and inserting them into the database.
- Implemented parallel uploading of files and chunks to Supabase, ensuring data integrity.

### Achievements
- Resolved the 404 error with Supabase documents table.
- Enhanced metadata management and file processing with [[Python]].
- Improved error handling and data integrity in file uploads to Supabase.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the parallel upload process to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring of the metadata management system for any discrepancies.
