## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Enhanced Metadata Management and Supabase Synchronization

**🕒 14:20–15:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Metadata, Supabase, Python, Synchronization, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to improve the handling of file metadata in the `process_books_dir` function and ensure seamless synchronization with the Supabase database.

### Key Activities
- **Updated the `process_books_dir` Function**: Improved metadata management by loading existing records and appending new entries without overwriting UUIDs.
- **Fixed Metadata Reset Issues**: Addressed bugs related to the reset of `files_metadata` and `chunks_metadata` by ensuring existing metadata is loaded and new entries are appended correctly.
- **Enhanced [[Debugging]] for Supabase Updates**: Implemented detailed logging and print statements to assist in debugging issues with updating chunks to Supabase.
- **Debugged Metadata Synchronization**: Resolved inconsistencies between local metadata and Supabase, focusing on duplicate key errors and synchronization logic.
- **Synced Local Metadata to Supabase**: Developed a [[Python]] function to push local metadata to Supabase with error handling and workflow integration.
- **Synced New Chunks to Supabase**: Modified functions to append only new chunks, checking for existing file IDs to avoid re-uploading.
- **Diagnosed and Fixed Chunk Upload Issues**: Identified and resolved chunk ID conflicts during uploads to Supabase by checking for existing chunks before upload.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the metadata management process and ensured efficient synchronization with Supabase.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the new synchronization functions in a production environment.
- Continuous monitoring and debugging of the Supabase integration to ensure long-term stability.
