## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Fixed Metadata Upload in Supabase Integration

**🕒 16:30–17:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Supabase, metadata, Python, debugging, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to diagnose and fix issues related to metadata handling in a Supabase integration using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed an invalid metadata format error in a [[JSON]] file, providing code snippets for validation and [[debugging]].
- Corrected the metadata upload process in the `upload_chunks_to_supabase` function by ensuring a list of dictionaries is used instead of a string path.
- Fixed the metadata loading issue in the Supabase upload function to ensure the correct data type is passed.
- Resolved a bug where a filename was incorrectly passed instead of the required metadata list, including code corrections and explanations.
- Developed an all-in-one [[Python]] function for syncing chunks to Supabase, which loads, validates, and uploads only missing chunks.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed the metadata format error and ensured the correct data handling in the Supabase integration.
- Streamlined the synchronization process with an automated function.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the all-in-one function to ensure robust [[error handling]] and efficiency in different scenarios.
