## 📅 2025-02-01 — Session: Optimized Supabase File Management and API Integration

**🕒 19:40–21:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Supabase, API, File Management, Python, Optimization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize file management processes and enhance [[API]] integration with Supabase.

### Key Activities
- Identified and optimized redundancies in file processing, focusing on deduplication and metadata tracking.
- Fixed recursion and looping issues in Supabase file management to prevent unnecessary deletions.
- Debugged issues with chunk uploads to Supabase, ensuring successful file syncing.
- Handled recursive file event triggers to prevent redundant processing.
- Implemented a quick fix for syncing the `chunks` table in Supabase using a [[Python]] script.
- Developed a generalized [[Python]] function for uploading [[JSON]] metadata to Supabase tables.
- Tested Supabase [[API]] endpoints using [[Python]] scripts to ensure correct request handling.
- Debugged a 400 Bad Request error in Supabase by verifying payloads and troubleshooting security issues.
- Addressed POST request errors by ensuring single [[JSON]] object submissions.
- Created a function for optimized metadata uploads, minimizing unnecessary [[API]] calls.

### Achievements
- Enhanced file processing workflows and stabilized Supabase file management.
- Improved [[API]] integration with Supabase, ensuring efficient data uploads and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of optimized metadata upload function to ensure stability across different datasets.
