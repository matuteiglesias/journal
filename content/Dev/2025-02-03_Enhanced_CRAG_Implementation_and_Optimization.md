**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the CRAG system by integrating [[OpenAI]] for retrieval and synthesis, optimizing retrieval processes, and addressing various code issues for improved performance and reliability.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a new CRAG system using [[OpenAI]], eliminating the need for low-level embedding management and FAISS.
- Optimized retrieval processes with [[OpenAI]] embeddings to enhance efficiency.
- Developed a `time_logger` decorator and a `TimeBlock` context manager for performance monitoring.
- Outlined an [[optimization]] plan for embeddings with FAISS to avoid recomputation.
- Addressed text corruption issues in RAG processing by implementing a normalization function.
- Modified query processing for [[OpenAI]] RAG to improve logging and performance tracking.
- Resolved an `AttributeError` in the CRAG class and a `TypeError` in FAISS retrieval.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated [[OpenAI]] into the CRAG system, improving retrieval and synthesis.
- Enhanced code performance and reliability through [[optimization]] and error resolution.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented changes to ensure robustness.
- Documentation updates to reflect the new implementation and optimizations.
