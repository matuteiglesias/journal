## üìÖ 2025-02-05 ‚Äî Session: Unified Financial Data Processing and Visualization

**üïí 20:00‚Äì20:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Financial Functions, Python, Data Visualization, Automation, Currency Conversion  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the financial data processing and visualization pipeline by unifying and modularizing various functions.

### Key Activities
- **Unified Financial Functions**: Introduced `compute_transaction_series` to consolidate financial flows, improving scalability and maintainability.
- **Currency Conversion [[Integration]]**: Added currency conversion to the `load_sheet` function for consistent financial data preprocessing.
- **Financial Plotting Module**: Planned a modular function for financial plotting using [[Python]] and [[Matplotlib]].
- **Standard Financial Plots**: Outlined a structured approach for generating thematic financial insights using `plot_series()`.
- **TypeError Handling**: Resolved a TypeError with [[Pandas]] PeriodIndex in [[Matplotlib]] by converting to Timestamp.
- **Household Ledger [[Automation]]**: Automated the analysis of household ledger data for enhanced reporting.

### Achievements
- Enhanced modularity in financial data processing and visualization.
- Improved data consistency through integrated currency conversion.
- Developed a plan for a unified plotting module.
- Resolved compatibility issues in data visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the planned unified plotting module for financial charts.
- Further test and refine the household ledger automation workflow.
