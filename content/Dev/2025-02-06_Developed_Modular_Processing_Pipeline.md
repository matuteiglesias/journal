**🕒 22:15–23:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Modular Design, Document Processing, Ai Engineering, Chunk Enrichment, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design and implement a modular processing pipeline for document handling, focusing on text extraction and metadata management.

### Key Activities
- Outlined the architecture of a modular processing pipeline with components for file processing, text chunking, and notebook-based execution.
- Designed a framework for chunk enrichment tasks using [[AI]] techniques like summarization and sentiment analysis.
- Established best practices and design patterns for [[AI]] engineering in chunk querying and metadata extraction.
- Developed a modular chunk processing system with components like ChunkManager, ChunkProcessor, and ChunkEnricher.
- Implemented one-liner tests for `ChunkManager` methods to ensure functionality.
- Managed temporary test files in [[Python]] to improve testing processes.
- Fixed dynamic text passing in `ChunkEnricher` to ensure proper OpenAI [[API]] integration.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed a comprehensive modular processing pipeline architecture.
- Implemented robust testing procedures for the `ChunkManager` class.
- Enhanced the `ChunkEnricher` class for better [[API]] integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the entire pipeline.
- [[Optimization]] of [[AI]] workflows for chunk enrichment.
