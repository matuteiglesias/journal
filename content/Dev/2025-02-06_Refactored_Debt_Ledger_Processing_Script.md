- Optimized the financial analysis workflow with standardized time aggregation and centralized data handling.
- Analyzed and classified financial tables for enhanced reporting and insights.

### Achievements
- Improved maintainability and performance of the debt ledger processing script.
- Streamlined data retrieval and preprocessing for financial analysis.
- Enhanced safety and accuracy in DataFrame manipulations.
- Provided a structured workflow for outstanding debt computation.
- Enabled dynamic financial reporting and analysis through table classification and insights.

### Pending Tasks
