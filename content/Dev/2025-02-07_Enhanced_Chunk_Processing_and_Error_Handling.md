## 📅 2025-02-07 — Session: Enhanced Chunk Processing and Error Handling

**🕒 00:00–01:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Chunk Processing, Error Handling, JSON, Python, Data Storage  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to enhance the chunk processing systems and address [[JSON]] parsing errors in various components.

### Key Activities
- **ChunkHandler & ChunkEnricher Patterns**: Explored and documented [[AI]] processing patterns using chunk-based architectures.
- **Design Plan for Chunk Processing System**: Outlined a design plan to enhance ChunkManager and ChunkProcessor for better adaptability and scalability.
- **Enhanced ChunkManager**: Introduced a query language for dynamic filtering of metadata.
- **Flow for Academic Chunks**: Developed a workflow for filtering and summarizing academic chunks using [[Python]].
- **[[JSON]] Parsing Error Fixes**: Addressed [[JSON]] parsing errors in OpenAI [[API]] responses and `summarize_research()` function.
- **Data Storage Enhancements**: Upgraded enrichment data storage with multi-collection support and implemented `get_collection_data()` in ChunkManager.

### Achievements
- Successfully documented and implemented enhancements in chunk processing and error handling.
- Improved data storage solutions with multi-collection support.
- Fixed [[JSON]] parsing issues, enhancing the robustness of the system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimize the summarization workflow for academic chunks.
- Continue to refine [[JSON]] schema for academic draft summarizer.
