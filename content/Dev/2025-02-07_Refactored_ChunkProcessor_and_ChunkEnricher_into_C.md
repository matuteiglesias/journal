## 📅 2025-02-07 — Session: Refactored ChunkProcessor and ChunkEnricher into ChunkHandler

**🕒 18:55–19:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Refactoring, Ai Integration, Class Design, Dynamic Function Calls, Json Schemas  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to refactor existing classes to improve modularity and maintainability, and to enhance system flexibility and scalability through dynamic function calls.

### Key Activities
- Refactored `ChunkProcessor` and `ChunkEnricher` classes into a unified `ChunkHandler` class.
- Implemented dynamic [[AI]] querying and modular function calls to allow customizable [[AI]] interactions.
- Developed tailored prompts for economic research functions, focusing on summarizing research papers, generating questions, and retrieving case studies.
- Created [[JSON]] schemas for structured question generation and case study retrieval.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored classes to create a more maintainable and modular codebase.
- Enhanced the system's flexibility and scalability with dynamic function calls.
- Developed comprehensive prompts and schemas to support economic research and educational content.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and integration of the new `ChunkHandler` class in production.
- Validation of the [[JSON]] schemas in live environments.
