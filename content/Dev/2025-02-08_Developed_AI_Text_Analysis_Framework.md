## 📅 2025-02-08 — Session: Developed AI Text Analysis Framework

**🕒 22:35–23:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: AI, Text Analysis, Schema, Reading Strategies, Cognitive Science  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a framework for [[AI]] systems to perform expert-level comprehension of book texts, focusing on surface-level understanding and text analysis.

### Key Activities
- Outlined cognitive processes for analyzing text chunks from books.
- Proposed a framework for designing [[AI]] systems mimicking expert comprehension.
- Discussed challenges in [[AI]]-based text analysis.
- Created a [[JSON]] schema and prompt for [[AI]] reading.
- Developed a structured approach for [[AI]] to perform surface-level text analysis.
- Designed structured prompts for [[AI]] text analysis.
- Explored strategies for passage type detection and text structuring.
- Presented a [[JSON]] schema for extracting structured information from book excerpts.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive framework for [[AI]] text analysis.
- Created structured prompts and schema for [[AI]] reading comprehension.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the designed framework and schema in a practical [[AI]] system.
