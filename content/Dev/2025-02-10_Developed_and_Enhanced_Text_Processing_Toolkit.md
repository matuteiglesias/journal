**üïí 18:20‚Äì19:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: FAISS, Langchain, Text Processing, Error Handling, Querying  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop and enhance a text processing toolkit, focusing on querying capabilities for a FAISS knowledge base and resolving various programming challenges.

### Key Activities
- **Building a Query Toolkit**: Developed a querying toolkit for a FAISS knowledge base using LangChain, implementing various query functions.
- **Error Resolution**: Resolved `ImportError` for `LanguageTextSplitter` in LangChain by updating packages and modifying import statements.
- **Dynamic Text Splitter**: Implemented a dynamic text splitter for various file formats, improving text processing capabilities.
- **MIME Type Handling**: Updated functions to handle MIME types in text processing, mapping them to appropriate text splitters.
- **Text Splitter Function Update**: Corrected and enhanced the `get_text_splitter` function for MIME types.
- **[[Error Handling]] in spaCy**: Addressed missing spaCy model error by providing installation solutions.
- **Function Enhancements**: Enhanced the `process_chunks` function to count and display character and word counts for text chunks.
- **Data Storage Planning**: Outlined a structured map for data storage, focusing on file organization and metadata.
- **Querying [[Strategy]] Design**: Designed querying needs across [[AI]] workflows for efficient information retrieval.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a robust querying toolkit for FAISS.
- Resolved multiple programming errors and improved text processing functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the querying toolkit and text processing functions.
- [[Integration]] of the toolkit with existing [[AI]] workflows.
