**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve debugging issues and optimize embedding strategies for cost efficiency.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] Issue Resolved:** Fixed the initial directory scan issue that triggered indexing before event-based filtering, allowing progress to continue.
- **Optimizing Embedding Strategies:** Outlined strategies for embedding text data efficiently, emphasizing on-demand embedding to reduce costs and improve storage management.
- **Optimizing Vector Store Management:** Developed a systematic approach to managing vector store collections, focusing on retrieval optimization and cost reduction.
- **Dynamic Collection Management in Notebook:** Implemented a structured notebook cell for managing dynamic collections, including defining collections and embedding chunks based on metadata filtering.
- **[[Debugging]] [[Jupyter]] Notebook Import Issues:** Addressed common issues and solutions for importing [[Python]] modules in [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.
- **Implementation of `get_chunks_for_collection` in TextManager:** Implemented a function to retrieve chunk IDs based on specified dataset paths.
- **Fixing Metadata Loading in [[Python]] Class:** Ensured `self.chunks_metadata` is loaded correctly as a dictionary from a [[JSON]] file.
- **Fix Function Output and Iteration for Embedding Pipeline:** Fixed functions to ensure correct data handling in the embedding pipeline.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved debugging issues in both directory scanning and [[Jupyter]] Notebook imports.
- Optimized embedding strategies and vector store management for cost efficiency.
- Implemented dynamic collection management and fixed metadata handling in [[Python]] classes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the implemented solutions in a production environment.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of embedding strategies based on usage patterns.
