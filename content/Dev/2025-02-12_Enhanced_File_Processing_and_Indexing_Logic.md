### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the file processing and indexing logic in [[Python]], focusing on handling large files, improving [[error handling]], and refining Git-related file exclusions.

### Key Activities
- Implemented [[error handling]] for Spacy's text length limit using try-except blocks to skip oversized documents.
- Explained the occurrence of duplicate SHA-256 hashes in repositories and provided ignore patterns for indexing.
- Refactored [[Python]] code for modular file indexing and chunking, addressing ignored directories and extensions.
- Defined default ingestion settings for [[workflow]] management, allowing for necessary overrides.
- Modified code to filter ignored files from pending processing.
- Implemented separate filtering rules for indexing and chunking to ensure ignored files do not affect the [[workflow]].
- Diagnosed and proposed solutions for Git ignore logic issues, focusing on filtering logic for nested paths and directories.
- Conducted atomic comparison tests to verify the correct detection and exclusion of '.git/' paths.

### Achievements
- Successfully improved [[error handling]] in file processing, ensuring stability in the ingestion pipeline.
- Enhanced the modularity and clarity of the file indexing and chunking processes.
- Established effective filtering logic for Git-related files, ensuring they are excluded from indexing.
- Verified through testing that the directory-based ignoring logic functions as intended.

### Pending Tasks
- Further investigate the processing flow to ensure ignored files are handled correctly beyond initial detection.
