## 📅 2025-02-14 — Session: Automated Workflow Design and System Maintenance

**🕒 10:50–11:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Flowise, automation, disk space, pnpm, workflow, system maintenance  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design an automated [[workflow]] generator using Flowise and resolve system maintenance issues related to disk space and package management.

### Key Activities
- Designed a Workflow Generator using Flowise to convert [[automation]] ideas into structured [[workflow]] blueprints, including nodes, integrations, and deployment strategies.
- Resolved 'No Space Left on Device' error by identifying and deleting large files, freeing up disk space, and reinstalling Flowise.
- Managed disk space in the `/home` partition using Linux commands and ensured a clean reinstallation of Flowise.
- Assessed the impact of deleting cache files, specifically on saved passwords and login sessions.
- Installed Flowise using pnpm, highlighting its advantages over npm for handling dependencies.
- Fixed issues related to `pnpm` configuration, including resolving errors like 'Unable to find the global bin directory' and `pnpm config get global-bin-dir` returning `undefined`.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed a blueprint for automated [[workflow]] generation.
- Cleared disk space and resolved installation issues, ensuring system stability and efficient package management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the automated [[workflow]] generator to ensure robustness and integration with existing systems.
