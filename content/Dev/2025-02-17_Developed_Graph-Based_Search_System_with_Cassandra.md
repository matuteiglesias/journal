## 📅 2025-02-17 — Session: Developed Graph-Based Search System with Cassandra

**🕒 17:10–18:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: graph search, Cassandra, NLP, text classification, embeddings, clustering  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and enhance a graph-based search system integrated with Cassandra for efficient storage and retrieval of text chunks.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed the structure and functionality of a graph-based search system and its integration with Cassandra.
- Proposed enhancements to the current data structure, focusing on robustness and the introduction of new analysis tables.
- Discussed knowledge aggregation techniques to form coherent higher-level units.
- Explored [[NLP]] techniques to transform annotations into a knowledge web.
- Summarized state-of-the-art models in Hugging Face for text classification.
- Planned a script for text chunk classification using embeddings and clustering.
- Outlined a structured approach for text categorization using embeddings and clustering.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of the graph-based search system and proposed enhancements.
- Identified methods for knowledge aggregation and text categorization.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed enhancements to the data structure.
- Develop and test the script for text chunk classification.
- Further explore and integrate [[NLP]] techniques for building a knowledge web.
