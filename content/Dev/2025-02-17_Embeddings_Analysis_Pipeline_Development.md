## 📅 2025-02-17 — Session: Embeddings Analysis Pipeline Development

**🕒 21:20–22:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Embeddings, UMAP, Data Visualization, Python, Clustering  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing datasets of embeddings, focusing on dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization techniques.

### Key Activities
- Developed a guide for analyzing embeddings, including techniques for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.
- Converted [[CSV]] embeddings into lists or NumPy arrays for processing.
- Implemented a [[Python]] script to convert string embeddings for UMAP dimensionality reduction.
- Created a visualization script using UMAP and Plotly for interactive scatter plots.
- Enhanced Plotly visualizations with multiline hover text.
- Developed a pipeline using PCA and UMAP for clustering and visualization.
- Calculated cosine distances to identify duplicate embeddings.
- Explored strategies for cluster representation using centroids and summaries.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a detailed pipeline for embeddings analysis, integrating PCA, UMAP, K-Means, and Plotly.
- Implemented code snippets for each stage of the process, facilitating reproducibility.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of the pipeline for larger datasets.
- Exploration of additional clustering techniques beyond K-Means.
