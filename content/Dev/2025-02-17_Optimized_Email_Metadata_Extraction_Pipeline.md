**🏷️ Labels**: email, metadata, Python, graph analysis, Spider API  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to optimize and document the email metadata extraction pipeline, focusing on efficiency and modular design.

### Key Activities
- Developed a modular [[Python]] pipeline for extracting, analyzing, and storing email metadata from an MBOX file.
- Conducted graph analysis and generated insights from the extracted data.
- Documented the process and outlined next steps for further analysis and [[automation]].

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized the email metadata extraction process.
- Enhanced the pipeline with graph analysis capabilities.
- Generated actionable insights from the data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[automation]] of the analysis process.
- Exploration of additional insights that can be derived from the metadata.

### Additional Activities
- Utilized Spider [[API]] for thematic crawling to gather information about institutions, including setup, authentication, crawling procedures, data extraction, and handling authenticated pages.
- Conducted a crawling analysis of the ICC website, summarizing key observations about site structure, recent news, academic achievements, and potential uses for monitoring and analysis.
