### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to explore various summarization techniques and implement retrieval-augmented generation models for document retrieval and processing large text collections.

### Key Activities
- Explored extractive vs. abstractive summarization methods and generative summarization techniques.
- Detailed the use of the RAG model for document retrieval, including dataset preparation and querying.
- Built a quote finder using the RAG model's retrieval component.
- Discussed handling large text collections with FAISS and DPR, focusing on scalability and memory requirements.
- Created a Hugging Face Dataset with FAISS indexing, including embedding computation and dataset saving.
- Corrected FAISS index handling and resolved related errors in Hugging Face datasets.
- Developed a modular script structure for [[data processing]] and retrieval.
- Improved retrieval accuracy in FAISS by refining embedding models and using semantic similarity.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and corrected FAISS index handling in datasets.
- Developed a robust modular script for [[data processing]] and retrieval.

### Pending Tasks
- Further explore and refine semantic ranking strategies for improved retrieval accuracy.
- Continue to optimize the performance of summarization and retrieval models.
