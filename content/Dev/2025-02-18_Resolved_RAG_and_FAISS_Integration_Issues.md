**üïí 17:00‚Äì17:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: RAG, FAISS, Transformers, Error Handling, Code Fixes  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to resolve issues related to the integration of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model with FAISS indexing and ensure proper configuration and usage of the tokenizer and retriever components.

### Key Activities
- **Resolved RAG Tokenizer Error**: Addressed an error with loading a RAG tokenizer from a DPR model, providing a solution and explanation of the model requirements.
- **Corrected RAG Model Usage**: Fixed a ValueError by suggesting appropriate RAG models and explaining the requirements for a valid RAG configuration.
- **Resolved Missing Embeddings in RAG Dataset**: Provided code correction for missing 'embeddings' in the dataset used with the RAG retriever.
- **Troubleshot FAISS Index Loading Issues**: Outlined steps to troubleshoot and fix issues related to loading a FAISS index.
- **Successful FAISS Index Loading**: Confirmed the successful loading of the FAISS index and provided instructions for instantiating the RagRetriever.
- **Issues and Fixes in RAG Code Implementation**: Identified issues in the RAG implementation code and provided corrected code snippets.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple integration issues with RAG and FAISS, ensuring that the tokenizer, retriever, and index components are correctly configured and operational.

### Pending Tasks
- Further integration of retrieval with a RAG model for text generation, as suggested in the corrected code snippets.
