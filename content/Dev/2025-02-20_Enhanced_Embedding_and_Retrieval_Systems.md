**üïí 20:40‚Äì22:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, FAISS, Hugging Face, Embedding, Retrieval, Caching  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the efficiency and modularity of embedding and retrieval systems using [[Python]], FAISS, and Hugging Face models.

### Key Activities
- **Argument Parsing in [[Jupyter]]**: Fixed command-line argument parsing for [[Jupyter]] notebooks to ensure proper execution based on specified modes.
- **Dynamic Embedding Model Selection**: Modified the system to allow dynamic selection of embedding models and incremental updates to FAISS indexes without full rebuilds.
- **Embedding Storage Structuring**: Organized embedding storage across multiple collections using FAISS and Parquet files for efficient data retrieval.
- **Hugging Face Model Caching**: Implemented strategies for local caching of Hugging Face models to enhance embedding process efficiency.
- **Embedder Script [[Integration]]**: Integrated a modular embedder script into [[AI]] workflows, improving knowledge processing and retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Developed a modular code structure for [[AI]] knowledge retrieval, focusing on embedding, storage, and retrieval modules.
- **Retriever Enhancements**: Enhanced the retriever system with hybrid search capabilities, transformer re-ranking, and web [[API]] integration.

### Achievements
- Improved performance and modularity of embedding and retrieval systems.
- Established a structured approach for embedding storage and retrieval.
- Enhanced [[AI]] workflow integration with modular scripts and caching strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of modular retrieval systems and exploration of additional caching strategies.
- Continued enhancements to the CLI and embedder class for better performance.
