## 📅 2025-02-21 — Session: Enhanced FAISS Search and Embedding Management

**🕒 17:05–18:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: FAISS, embeddings, debugging, semantic search, data integrity  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to evaluate and improve the semantic search quality using FAISS and embedding models, focusing on [[debugging]] and optimizing the `Embedder` class and FAISS index management.

### Key Activities
- Tested the `text-embedding-3-small` model for semantic search in [[data science]] literature.
- Evaluated FAISS search results for [[machine learning]] queries, identifying issues with embeddings.
- Improved search quality by refining FAISS ranking and embedding strategies.
- Debugged the `Embedder` class to fix dimension mismatches and [[API]] response handling.
- Updated the `Embedder` class for proper FAISS index tracking and refactored code.
- Fixed issues with undefined `faiss_idx` in the `store_faiss` function.
- Verified FAISS index functionality and embedding storage integrity.
- Conducted a critical analysis of FAISS search results for the stream data model.
- Implemented solutions to prevent duplicate embeddings in FAISS.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the semantic relevance and retrieval accuracy of FAISS search results.
- Improved the robustness of the `Embedder` class and FAISS index management.
- Successfully prevented duplicate embeddings, ensuring data integrity.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the embedding models with diverse datasets to validate improvements.
- Continuous monitoring and refinement of FAISS index management strategies.
