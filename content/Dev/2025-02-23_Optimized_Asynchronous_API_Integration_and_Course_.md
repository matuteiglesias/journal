## 📅 2025-02-23 — Session: Optimized Asynchronous API Integration and Course Blueprint Refactoring

**🕒 20:15–21:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Openai, Api Integration, Async Programming, Error Handling, Course Design  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the integration of asynchronous [[API]] calls using OpenAI and improve the codebase for generating course session blueprints.

### Key Activities
- Explored efficient batch [[API]] calls with OpenAI, focusing on asynchronous requests and the official Batch [[API]].
- Implemented an asynchronous translation process for a DataFrame's 'Snippet' column using OpenAI's [[API]].
- Resolved `asyncio` RuntimeError in [[Jupyter]] Notebooks by using the `nest_asyncio` library.
- Debugged OpenAI [[API]] failures, focusing on rate limits and invalid responses.
- Fixed `TypeError` encountered in asynchronous OpenAI [[API]] calls, ensuring proper functionality.
- Refactored code for generating course session blueprints, including renaming functions and updating docstrings.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented asynchronous [[API]] calls with error handling improvements.
- Enhanced the course session blueprint generation codebase for better curriculum design.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of asynchronous [[API]] integration in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring of [[API]] performance and error rates.
