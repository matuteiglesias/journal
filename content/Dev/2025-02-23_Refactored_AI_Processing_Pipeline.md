**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance the [[AI]] processing pipeline by improving modularity, error handling, and the integration of query text into [[AI]] prompts.

### Key Activities
- **Literature Review Synthesis Instructions**: Developed a structured approach for curating and synthesizing literature excerpts into a coherent academic review.
- **Alternative [[AI]] Query Implementation**: Implemented an alternative [[AI]] query function with improved error handling.
- **Function Naming Best Practices**: Established clear naming conventions for [[AI]] query functions to enhance code readability.
- **Improved [[AI]] Query Functions**: Updated the `query_ai_freeform` function to handle [[JSON]] parsing issues and log errors effectively.
- **Understanding Abstraction Elevation**: Reflected on software design principles to improve productivity and modularity.
- **Modularization [[Strategy]]**: Developed a strategy for modularizing the [[AI]] processing pipeline into distinct components.
- **Refactored [[Python]] Script**: Organized the [[AI]] processing pipeline into well-defined modules for better maintainability.
- **Modifying [[AI]] Processing [[Pipeline]]**: Adjusted the pipeline to include `query_text` for more relevant [[AI]] responses.
- **Streamlined [[AI]] Prompt for Academic Review**: Designed a refined prompt to improve [[AI]]-generated literature reviews.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the [[AI]] processing pipeline to improve modularity and readability.
- Enhanced error handling and logging in [[AI]] query functions.
- Integrated query text into the [[AI]] processing pipeline to enhance the relevance of [[AI]] responses.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new modular components.
- Continuous improvement of [[AI]] prompts based on academic feedback.
