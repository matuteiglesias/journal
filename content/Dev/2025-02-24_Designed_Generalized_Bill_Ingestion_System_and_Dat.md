## 📅 2025-02-24 — Session: Designed Generalized Bill Ingestion System and Data Schema

**🕒 21:15–21:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: bill ingestion, data extraction, financial schema, automation, credit card processing, property tax  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to design a generalized system for bill ingestion, data extraction from financial documents, and creating a unified data schema for financial reporting.

### Key Activities:
- **Bill Ingestion System Design**: Developed a plan for parsing bills from PDFs, standardizing the data, and storing it in a structured format. This included creating custom parsers for different bill types and automating the data ingestion process.
- **Directory Structure Analysis**: Analyzed the directory structure for organizing raw data, identified strengths and potential issues, and provided recommendations for an automated ingestion pipeline.
- **Document Understanding**: Differentiated between CuponPago and Factura documents from AySA, proposed a data structure design, and outlined an ingestion plan.
- **Credit Card Data Extraction**: Discussed extracting data from credit card statements, including key fields and integration into a financial [[data processing]] pipeline.
- **Unified Parsing Approach**: Proposed a unified approach for parsing Visa and Mastercard statements.
- **General Financial Schema Design**: Outlined a schema for managing financial documents, including tables for bills, credit card transactions, and payments.
- **Property Tax Bills Analysis**: Analyzed property tax bills to suggest a parser design for effective handling.

### Achievements:
- Developed a comprehensive plan for a generalized bill ingestion system.
- Created a unified data schema for financial documents.
- Proposed a unified parsing approach for Visa and Mastercard statements.

### Pending Tasks:
- Implement the designed parsers and ingestion pipeline.
- Test the unified data schema with sample data.
- Develop a parser for property tax bills based on the analysis.
