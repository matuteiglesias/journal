## 📅 2025-02-25 — Session: Updated and Optimized Financial Document Processing Pipeline

**🕒 01:30–02:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pipeline, YAML, Python, Asynchronous, Openai, Configuration  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to update and optimize the financial document processing pipeline to improve efficiency and maintainability.

### Key Activities
- Updated the pipeline configuration for bill processing, transitioning from retrieval-based [[AI]] to structured document parsing.
- Corrected YAML structure for defining multiple pipelines to prevent configuration errors.
- Fixed YAML pipeline access errors in [[Python]] by adjusting the access method from dictionary to list.
- Implemented dynamic configuration access in YAML for better scalability.
- Refactored two similar functions into a single asynchronous function for processing financial documents using OpenAI's [[API]].
- Provided guidance on handling asynchronous functions in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated and optimized the pipeline configuration.
- Improved error handling and code reusability through refactoring.
- Enhanced the maintainability of the configuration files.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated pipeline in a production environment to ensure robustness.
- Monitor the performance of the new asynchronous function in real-time scenarios.
