## 📅 2025-02-27 — Session: Backup and Data Cleanup

**🕒 16:40–16:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: backup, data management, file organization, rsync, optimization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to manage and optimize backup data by merging old backups, cleaning up redundant files, and revamping outdated projects.

### Key Activities
- Merged and cleaned up old backups using structured workflows to ensure no data loss while removing duplicates.
- Explored faster methods to analyze large directories without using the `du` command, focusing on tools like `find` and `rsync` for efficiency.
- Developed a detailed plan for cleaning up the `Matias_Iglesias_Backup/` directory, including identifying redundant files and archiving large datasets to [[Google Cloud]] Storage (GCS).
- Diagnosed and revamped the old project `compute-corr-structures/` by identifying storage issues and reorganizing it into a lean educational repository.
- Saved processed file names from the `/data/processed/` directory into a `README.txt` file before deletion, ensuring future reference with optional timestamps.

### Achievements
- Successfully merged and optimized backup data, ensuring efficient storage management.
- Enhanced project organization by revamping outdated repositories and documenting processed files.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of backup directory analysis and cleanup.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of backup strategies to prevent data redundancy.
