## 📅 2025-02-27 — Session: Ethical and Technical Reflections on Data Use

**🕒 15:10–15:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Ethics, Deep Learning, Data Privacy, Regularization, Transfer Learning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore both ethical and technical considerations of data use, particularly focusing on census data, deep learning techniques for a thesis, and regularization strategies for structured data.

### Key Activities
- Reflected on the ethical implications of making census databases public and the responsibilities of using publicly available data.
- Evaluated the use of greedy layer-wise pretraining and transfer learning for deep learning thesis applications.
- Analyzed regularization strategies for population-structured data and assessed the relevance of Hinton et al. (2006) paper to current data work.

### Achievements
- Developed insights into ethical data use and legal considerations for researchers.
- Identified key deep learning techniques relevant to thesis work.
- Highlighted effective regularization strategies for structured data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of alternative learning approaches in deep learning.
- Continued assessment of ethical frameworks for data sharing.
