## üìÖ 2025-02-28 ‚Äî Session: PostgreSQL and Email Data Processing Enhancements

**üïí 22:45‚Äì23:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PostgreSQL, JSONB, Email Analysis, CRM, Data Import, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the processing and analysis of email data using PostgreSQL, focusing on JSONB fields, timestamp parsing, and robust data import scripts.

### Key Activities
- **Extracting and Storing JSONB Fields:** Created a new `email_details` table in PostgreSQL to store JSONB fields from the `emails` table, including [[automation]] through triggers.
- **Correcting Timestamp Parsing:** Adjusted the PostgreSQL `to_timestamp()` function for accurate email timestamp parsing.
- **Robust Email Import Script:** Developed a [[Python]] script for batch processing emails into PostgreSQL, addressing [[error handling]] for untranslatable characters and malformed [[JSON]].
- **Improved JSONB Insertion Script:** Enhanced a [[Python]] script for inserting JSONB data into PostgreSQL, focusing on null byte issues and transaction handling.
- **EDA Plan for Email Dataset:** Outlined a comprehensive exploratory [[data analysis]] plan for the email dataset.
- **[[CRM]] Email Dataset Insights:** Analyzed email data to optimize [[CRM]] management, focusing on engagement and follow-up improvements.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and automated JSONB field extraction and storage in PostgreSQL.
- Improved data import processes with robust [[error handling]] and batch processing.
- Developed a structured EDA plan to gain insights into email [[communication]] patterns.
- Identified actionable improvements for [[CRM]] management through email [[data analysis]].

### Pending Tasks
- Upload the dataset in [[CSV]] or [[JSON]] format for further processing as requested.
