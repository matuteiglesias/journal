### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze email data and enhance keyword extraction techniques using [[Python]] and [[NLP]] methods.

### Key Activities
- **DataFrame Filtering:** Implemented a [[Python]] function to filter email data based on sender and receiver addresses.
- **Email Data Insights:** Generated insights from email exchanges, focusing on collaboration patterns and [[communication]] themes.
- **LDA Keyword Extraction:** Applied LDA for keyword extraction, involving text preprocessing and topic visualization.
- **LDA Output Analysis:** Evaluated LDA results and suggested improvements for better topic separation.
- **RAKE Optimization:** Improved RAKE keyword extraction by addressing issues with irrelevant metadata and generic words.
- **RAKE Evaluation:** Assessed RAKE output quality and proposed enhancements using Named Entity Recognition and LDA.

### Achievements
- Successfully filtered and analyzed email data, extracting meaningful insights and keywords.
- Enhanced keyword extraction processes using LDA and RAKE, improving accuracy and relevance.

### Pending Tasks
