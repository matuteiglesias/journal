### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance and automate the management of Google Drive data using various tools and scripts.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] function to manage root-level files in Google Drive and correctly identify their parent folders.
- Implemented a solution to accurately retrieve parent folder names for files, especially in shared drives.
- Exported a full directory tree from Google Drive using `gdrive4` and mapped file IDs to folder paths.
- Created a structured [[workflow]] for exporting and reconstructing a Google Drive index using command line and [[Python]] scripts.
- Configured `gdrive` CLI to authenticate with a [[Google Cloud]] service account for secure access.
- Set up `rclone` to work with Google Drive, generating a structured [[CSV]] from folder and file data.
- Troubleshot issues related to DNS resolution errors and empty [[CSV]] file generation.

### Achievements
- Successfully automated the retrieval and export of Google Drive data into structured formats.
- Improved the accuracy of file and folder path mapping in Google Drive.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the automated workflows to ensure robustness and scalability.
- [[Integration]] of these scripts into a larger data management system for continuous operation.
