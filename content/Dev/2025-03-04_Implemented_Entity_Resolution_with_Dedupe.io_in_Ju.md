## 📅 2025-03-04 — Session: Implemented Entity Resolution with Dedupe.io in Jupyter

**🕒 22:05–22:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Entity Resolution, Dedupe, Python, Jupyter, Data Cleaning  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to implement a robust entity resolution process using the Dedupe.io library within Jupyter Notebooks, addressing common issues and optimizing the deduplication workflow.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed robust entity resolution techniques focusing on clustering records using probabilistic and deterministic matching.
- Implemented Dedupe.io for probabilistic entity resolution in [[Python]], utilizing active learning and fuzzy matching.
- Resolved command-line argument conflicts in Jupyter Notebooks related to the `optparse` library.
- Adapted a [[Python]] script for deduplication using Dedupe in Jupyter, covering data loading to output saving.
- Corrected syntax for variable definitions in Dedupe 3.0, transitioning from dictionary to direct variable objects.
- Fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` in Dedupe by converting empty strings to None.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a complete deduplication workflow in Jupyter using Dedupe.io.
- Resolved technical issues related to command-line arguments and variable definitions.
- Improved data cleaning processes by addressing common errors and optimizing the deduplication script.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the deduplication script on larger datasets to ensure scalability and efficiency.
