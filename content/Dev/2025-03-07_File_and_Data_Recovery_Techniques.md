The objective of this session was to explore and document various techniques for recovering corrupted files, specifically focusing on LibreOffice and [[CSV]] files, as well as addressing data assignment issues in [[Pandas]] DataFrames.

### Key Activities
- **File Encoding Recovery**: Utilized [[Python]] and the `iconv` command-line tool to address mixed encoding issues in files.
- **LibreOffice File Recovery**: Explored methods to recover corrupted LibreOffice files using previous versions, text-based backups, and hex editors.
- **[[CSV]] File Recovery**: Provided a detailed guide on recovering corrupted [[CSV]] files using LibreOffice's recovery features and alternative programs.
- **[[Pandas]] DataFrame Issues**: Addressed assignment issues in [[Pandas]] DataFrames, providing solutions using `assign()` and `update()` methods.

### Achievements
- Documented comprehensive recovery techniques for both LibreOffice and [[CSV]] files.
- Provided solutions to common [[Pandas]] DataFrame assignment issues.

### Pending Tasks
