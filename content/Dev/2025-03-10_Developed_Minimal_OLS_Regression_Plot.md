## 📅 2025-03-10 — Session: Developed Minimal OLS Regression Plot

**🕒 12:45–13:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Visualization, Regression, Numpy, Matplotlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to create a minimal Seaborn-like `regplot` clone for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using [[Python]] libraries such as NumPy and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities
- Implemented a basic version of Seaborn's `regplot()` focusing on OLS regression with NumPy, including scatter plot creation and linear regression line fitting.
- Developed a minimalist regression plot using NumPy and [[Matplotlib]], emphasizing essential OLS fitting.
- Demonstrated the replication of Seaborn's `regplot` functionality using basic linear algebra for OLS regression.
- Updated the OLS regression script to include the `regress_out()` function for removing linear dependencies, enhancing interpretability.
- Explored the statistical technique of regressing variable B from A while maintaining A's mean, detailing the mathematical steps involved.
- Planned a simplified implementation of Seaborn's regression plot using NumPy's pseudoinverse.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a minimal OLS regression plot using [[Python]], replicating essential functionalities of Seaborn's `regplot`.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the regression script to enhance flexibility and interpretability.
