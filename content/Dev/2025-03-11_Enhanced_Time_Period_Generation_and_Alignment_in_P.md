## 📅 2025-03-11 — Session: Enhanced Time Period Generation and Alignment in Pandas

**🕒 20:50–23:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Pandas, Time Series, Data Processing, Coding  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the generation and alignment of time periods using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]], with a focus on ensuring consistency and flexibility in handling different time frequencies.

### Key Activities
- Developed a corrected [[Python]] function for generating start and end dates based on specified time frequencies.
- Refined the approach to time period generation using [[Pandas]]' `pd.date_range` for flexible frequency handling.
- Corrected and improved the function to ensure proper alignment and end date calculations.
- Explored concepts for aligning and resampling time series data in [[Pandas]], particularly for exchange rate data integration.

### Achievements
- Successfully created and corrected [[Python]] functions to generate and align time periods using [[Pandas]].
- Enhanced understanding of time series alignment and resampling techniques in [[Pandas]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the functions with real-world data scenarios.
- [[Integration]] of the developed functions into existing [[data processing]] pipelines.
