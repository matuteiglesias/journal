## 📅 2025-03-12 — Session: Data Resampling and Visualization Enhancements

**🕒 00:00–04:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Pandas, Data Visualization, Financial Data, Resampling, Matplotlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance data handling and visualization techniques in [[Python]], focusing on [[Pandas]] and [[Matplotlib]].

### Key Activities
- **Preserving Time Index in [[Pandas]] [[CSV]] Operations**: Implemented strategies to ensure time index preservation when saving/loading DataFrames, recommending Parquet for performance.
- **Aesthetic Guidelines for Financial Visualization**: Developed guidelines for effective financial [[data visualization]] using line plots and clear labeling.
- **Fixing `PeriodIndex` Issues in [[Matplotlib]]**: Addressed `PeriodIndex` plotting issues by converting to `DatetimeIndex`.
- **Understanding Retained Earnings and Cumulative Net Profit**: Explored financial concepts and their application in [[data analysis]].
- **Fixing Resampling for Cumulative Data**: Improved resampling techniques to preserve cumulative data integrity.
- **Fixing Weekly Resampling Mismatch**: Ensured consistent weekly resampling in financial datasets.
- **Avoiding NaNs with `.reindex()`**: Provided solutions to prevent null values during data alignment.
- **Aligning PeriodIndex to DatetimeIndex**: Converted PeriodIndex to DatetimeIndex for consistent data alignment.

### Achievements
- Enhanced data resampling methods to ensure accurate financial reporting.
- Improved visualization techniques for financial time series data.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced visualization techniques for complex financial datasets.
