## 📅 2025-03-12 — Session: Enhanced Python Function for AI Metadata Extraction

**🕒 21:55–22:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, AI, Code Improvement, Markdown, Jupyter  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to enhance the implementation of [[Python]] functions related to [[AI]] exercise metadata extraction and improve the handling of educational content.

### Key Activities
- Corrected a [[Python]] function to ensure list fields are properly converted to strings before being inserted into an [[AI]] prompt.
- Updated the implementation of the `draft_exercise` function to handle list-based fields and missing values correctly.
- Modified code to return a free-text message response from the [[AI]], maintaining the original syntax and structure.
- Saved parsed exercises as Markdown files using exercise IDs as filenames.
- Converted Markdown files to [[Jupyter]] Notebooks using various tools like `nbformat`, `pandoc`, and `notedown`.

### Achievements
- Improved clarity and structure of generated problem statements.
- Enhanced the management and editing of exercise files by storing them as Markdown.
- Provided multiple methods for converting Markdown to [[Jupyter]] Notebooks, with detailed comparisons.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated functions to ensure robustness across different datasets.
- Explore additional optimization techniques for the conversion process.
