**🕒 20:25–20:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: git, version control, repository management, branch reset  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to manage and reset Git branches, particularly focusing on the `main` and `gh-pages` branches, to ensure proper version control and repository management.

### Key Activities
- Viewed today's Git commits and pushes to understand the current state of the repository.
- Restored a Git repository to a previous commit to recover from potential issues.
- Managed [[GitHub]] branches, diagnosing issues between `main` and `gh-pages` and providing recovery options.
- Reverted the `main` branch to its initial commit using reset and force push techniques.
- Addressed untracked files in the `main` branch to prevent overwriting during reset.
- Reset the `gh-pages` branch to its initial commit, ensuring a clean state.

### Achievements
- Successfully diagnosed and managed Git branch issues, ensuring both `main` and `gh-pages` branches are reset to their initial states.
- Provided comprehensive recovery and management steps for future reference.

### Pending Tasks
- Verify the integrity and functionality of the repository after resets.
- Monitor any further issues that might arise from these changes.
