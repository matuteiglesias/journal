- Addressed initialization of pagination variables and ensured correct display of zero-padded numbers.
- Implemented zero-padding for pagination titles dynamically in Hugo.
- Fixed `printf` formatting issues in `pagination.html` using `safeHTMLAttr` and `safeURL`.
- Resolved context mismatch errors in Hugo's pagination partials.
- Developed a robust solution for extracting and formatting numeric parts from titles with [[error handling]].

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented zero-padded pagination in Hugo, ensuring correct numerical sorting and display.
- Enhanced [[error handling]] and formatting robustness for pagination titles.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and test the pagination implementation on different Hugo sites to ensure consistency and reliability across various contexts.
