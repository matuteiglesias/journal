## 📅 2025-03-13 — Session: Resolved GitHub Pages Deployment Issues

**🕒 08:35–09:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Github, Hugo, Deployment, Web Development, Troubleshooting  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] GitHub Pages Theme Issues**: Steps were taken to ensure that GitHub Pages utilized the modified theme files by checking build logs, forcing Hugo to use local themes, verifying paths, and triggering new deployments.
- **Deploying Hugo Site**: A structured guide was followed to deploy the Hugo site to GitHub Pages, which included correcting output paths, committing changes, and verifying the deployment.
- **Fixing `gh-pages` Branch Checkout Error**: The session addressed the issue of the `gh-pages` branch being checked out in the main repository. This was resolved by removing the current checkout and setting it up as a worktree for cleaner deployment.
- **Safely Pushing to `gh-pages`**: Detailed steps were followed to ensure that only the built Hugo site was deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, maintaining the integrity of the version control.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved theme issues and ensured that the Hugo site was correctly deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Implemented a clean deployment strategy using [[Git]] worktrees.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the deployment for any further issues that may arise and optimize the deployment process as needed.
