**🕒 09:25–09:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Git, Deployment, Hugo, GitHub Pages

### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to resolve deployment issues with a Hugo site on [[GitHub]] Pages, specifically focusing on Git management and branch handling.

### Key Activities
- **Undoing Accidental Push to `gh-pages`:** Steps were taken to reset the `gh-pages` branch after an accidental push, including finding the last good commit and redeploying from the correct directory.
- **Assessing Repo Status & Deploying Properly:** Addressed issues with branch divergence, staged and committed local changes, and reset the `gh-pages` worktree for proper deployment.
- **Resolving Git Merge Issues:** Tackled the 'refusing to merge unrelated histories' problem, providing solutions for merging and resetting branches.
- **Force Overwriting Remote Git History:** Safely overwrote the remote Git repository with local files, including backup and deployment instructions.
- **Deploying a Hugo Site:** Rebuilt, tested, and deployed the Hugo site to [[GitHub]] Pages, ensuring all changes were staged and tested locally.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved Git merge and deployment issues.
- Deployed the Hugo site to [[GitHub]] Pages without errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the deployed site for any further issues.
- Consider automating parts of the deployment process to prevent future errors.
