- **Successful Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Extracted and cleaned Mercado Pago transaction data, ensuring correct parsing and handling of multi-line descriptions.
- **Fixed [[CSV]] Parsing Issues:** Resolved common [[CSV]] parsing errors in pandas by wrapping text fields in double quotes.
- **Corrected [[CSV]] File:** Re-saved [[CSV]] with properly quoted text fields to prevent parsing errors.
- **Fixed File Encoding Issues:** Addressed encoding errors by re-saving [[CSV]] with UTF-8 with BOM encoding.

### Achievements
