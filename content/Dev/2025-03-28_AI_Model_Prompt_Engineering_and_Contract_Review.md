### Session Goal
The session focused on two main objectives: enhancing [[AI]] model prompt engineering techniques and conducting a thorough review of legal contracts.

### Key Activities
1. **[[AI]] Model Prompt Engineering**
   - Developed strategies for evaluating [[AI]] models through complex prompts.
   - Created original prompts emphasizing user expertise and critical review.
   - Designed prompts to induce intelligent failure in [[AI]] models, aiding in training.
   - Conducted critical analysis of prompts for the Thale's Tales project.
   - Outlined question designs in advanced physics to challenge [[AI]] models.
   - Provided a [[workflow]] for developing complex MCQs.
   - Optimized prompt design with a checklist for clarity and complexity.
   - Utilized the GTFA Predictor for evaluating prompt complexity.
   - Finalized precision in model evaluation with CoT annotations.
   - Compiled a comprehensive checklist for high-quality [[AI]] training prompts.

2. **Contract Review**
   - Reviewed and suggested improvements for contract clarity and ambiguity reduction.
   - Provided detailed analysis and corrections for various types of contracts including mutuo and comodato.
   - Offered specific recommendations for payment terms, interests, and guarantees.
   - Conducted a final professional review of a contract with legal adjustments.

### Achievements
- Enhanced [[AI]] model training through improved prompt engineering techniques.
- Completed a thorough review of multiple legal contracts with actionable recommendations.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the refined prompts in [[AI]] model training sessions.
- Finalize and approve the revised contracts for execution.
