## üìÖ 2025-03-31 ‚Äî Session: Python Text Processing and SSH Deployment Automation

**üïí 16:45‚Äì23:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, SSH, Automation, Text Processing, AWS, Security  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address [[Python]] text processing tasks and automate SSH deployment processes.

### Key Activities
- **Text Normalization:** Implemented a [[Python]] function using the `unicodedata` module to normalize ASCII characters in text, applicable to DataFrame columns.
- **Date Conversion:** Utilized `pandas` to convert dates into Spanish format 'MES A√ëO'.
- **Ledger Translation:** Explored Spanish translation options for ledger captions in [[Python]].
- **File Transfer [[Automation]]:** Developed guidance on using `scp` with custom SSH ports and reconstructing SCP commands for file transfers.
- **[[Deployment]] [[Automation]]:** Proposed creating a `deploy.sh` script for automating file uploads to a web server, including adding an alias in `.bashrc`.
- **SSH Security and Access:** Managed SSH known hosts, verified server fingerprints, and addressed SSH connection issues, particularly with AWS Lightsail instances.

### Achievements
- Successfully normalized text and converted date formats in [[Python]].
- Provided comprehensive guidance on SSH file transfers and deployment automation.
- Enhanced SSH security practices and resolved access issues with AWS Lightsail.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the `deploy.sh` script for automated deployments.
- Further refine SSH connection troubleshooting steps for AWS Lightsail.
