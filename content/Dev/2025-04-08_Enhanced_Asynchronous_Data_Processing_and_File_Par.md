## 📅 2025-04-08 — Session: Enhanced Asynchronous Data Processing and File Parsing

**🕒 18:35–18:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: async, data extraction, Python, Pandas, OpenAI, automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance and stabilize the asynchronous data extraction and file parsing processes using [[Python]] and [[OpenAI]]'s [[API]].

### Key Activities
1. **Fixing Async [[AI]] Call for Document Parsing:** Implemented an asynchronous [[AI]] call to extract data from text snippets and save the results to a [[CSV]] file.
2. **Improved File Parsing in [[Pandas]]:** Addressed issues with whitespace and unexpected characters in file listings using [[Pandas]] and Regex.
3. **Integrating `get_recent_files()` into the File Processing Pipeline:** Added a reusable function for file retrieval and parsing into the existing pipeline.
4. **[[Error Handling]] in Asynchronous Data Extraction:** Corrected an error related to an undefined variable in a [[Python]] script, ensuring proper execution of asynchronous functions.
5. **Optimizing Asynchronous Data Extraction Pipeline:** Structured and stabilized the data extraction process using [[OpenAI]]'s [[API]].

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated asynchronous calls and improved file parsing mechanisms.
- Enhanced [[error handling]] and function integration within the [[data processing]] pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of the data extraction [[workflow]] for increased efficiency.
- Continuous monitoring and testing of the implemented solutions to ensure stability.
