### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and integrate components for scanning files and displaying them in a React application.

### Key Activities
- Developed a complete working component for scanning folders and dynamically displaying the file list, including error handling and state management.
- Fixed TypeScript type errors related to the `ScanFolderBox` component and the `useState` hook.
- Improved the UX of the Scanned Files view by transitioning from floating file cards to a structured table format inspired by ShadCN task list.
- Integrated the `FileListTable` component in React, transforming raw file paths into a structured format for display.
- Conducted a code review for the MVP interface, highlighting improvements for code organization and user experience.
- Adapted the `DataTableDemo` from `shadcn/ui` and `@tanstack/react-table` for displaying and managing scanned file data, including filtering, sorting, and actions.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and integrated components for file scanning and display.
- Resolved existing TypeScript errors and improved the user interface.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the integrated components to ensure robustness and user satisfaction.
