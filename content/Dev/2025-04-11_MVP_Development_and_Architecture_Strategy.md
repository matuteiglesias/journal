### Session Goal
The session focused on developing a strategic approach for building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a modular app architecture, emphasizing reusable components and future-proofing.

### Key Activities
- Designed a modular app architecture [[strategy]] for [[AI]] frameworks, focusing on reusable components and integration with platforms like Notion.
- Explored the [[API]] layer's role in software architecture, detailing routes and adapters for data handling.
- Developed an MVP execution checklist, covering folder setup, prompt schema, flow logic, [[AI]] block code, [[API]] endpoint details, frontend UI design, and future roadmap.
- Set up an MVP directory structure using terminal commands and outlined next steps.
- Created a phased development [[strategy]] to maintain momentum and clarity, focusing on small, repeatable steps.
- Defined roles in [[AI]] [[workflow]] architecture, detailing the responsibilities of `runner.py` and `adapters/local.py`.
- Provided boilerplate code for automating code review processes in [[Python]].
- Resolved a [[Python]] import name collision issue and fixed a missing function in `local.py`.
- Outlined a strategic merge plan for transitioning from a prototype to a clean MVP.
- Detailed an [[API]] setup migration plan using [[FastAPI]] for the new MVP.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive [[strategy]] for MVP development with clear execution steps and architecture design.
- Resolved technical issues related to [[Python]] imports and missing functions.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue with the [[API]] setup migration and finalize the MVP architecture.
- Implement the phased development [[strategy]] and monitor progress.
