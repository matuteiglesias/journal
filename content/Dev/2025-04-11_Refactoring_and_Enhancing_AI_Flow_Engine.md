**üïí 16:45‚Äì17:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI, Fastapi, Typescript, Python, Modular Design  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to reflect on and improve the modular system for an [[AI]] flow engine, focusing on FastAPI and Next.js integration.

### Key Activities
- **Reflection and Pruning**: Reviewed the current modular system, identifying areas for cleaning and optimization.
- **Fixing [[JSON]] Load Errors**: Addressed [[JSON]] loading errors in [[Python]], ensuring correct file paths and valid [[JSON]] structure.
- **Cleaning FastAPI Endpoints**: Improved [[API]] route organization by eliminating redundancy.
- **MVP Completion Roadmap**: Created a roadmap for MVP completion of the [[AI]] flow engine, detailing backend and frontend enhancements.
- **Designing Declarative [[AI]] [[Pipeline]]**: Planned the architecture for a flexible [[AI]] flow runner, focusing on dynamic [[API]] interactions.
- **Fixing TypeScript Errors**: Resolved TypeScript errors in React components using the `useState` hook.
- **Modular [[AI]] [[Workflow]] Engine Design**: Outlined the architecture for a modular [[AI]] workflow engine with detailed component descriptions.
- **Enhancing [[AI]] Flow Engine**: Implemented dynamic features in the [[AI]] flow engine, including a dynamic flow discovery [[API]].
- **TypeScript Compiler Fixes**: Solved TypeScript compiler errors related to dynamic schemas.
- **[[Refactoring]] [[API]] and Logic Structure**: Separated router and helper logic in FastAPI for maintainability.
- **Resolving Namespace Confusion**: Fixed [[Python]] import errors related to namespace confusion.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the modular design and functionality of the [[AI]] flow engine.
- Improved code organization and error handling across multiple components.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new [[API]] routes and dynamic features.
- Continued refinement of the modular architecture to support scalability.
