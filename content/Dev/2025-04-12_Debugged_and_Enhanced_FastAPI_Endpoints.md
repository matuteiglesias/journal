### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to debug and enhance FastAPI endpoints, focusing on resolving errors and improving file handling capabilities.

### Key Activities
- **Debugged FastAPI Code Review Endpoint**: Addressed issues in the code review endpoint, ensuring both frontend and backend components were adjusted for proper functionality.
- **Frontend and Backend Adaptation**: Implemented changes to handle file content correctly, ensuring smooth dispatch flows.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Diagnosed and fixed FastAPI errors, including 404 Not Found and 422 Unprocessable Entity responses.
- **Resolved TypeError in AsyncCompletions**: Fixed a TypeError in the `AsyncCompletions.create()` method with defensive programming patterns.
- **Token Limit Management**: Developed a strategy to handle token limits in [[AI]] models, including estimating token counts and splitting text inputs.
- **CORS Issues Resolution**: Enabled CORS in FastAPI to resolve frontend-backend communication errors.
- **Uvicorn Import Error Solution**: Provided solutions for common Uvicorn errors when running FastAPI servers.
- **[[API]] Flow Enhancement**: Improved [[API]] flow for file content handling, ensuring correct fetching and display of outputs.

### Achievements
