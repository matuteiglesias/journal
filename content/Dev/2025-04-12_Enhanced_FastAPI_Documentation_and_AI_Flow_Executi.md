- **Successful [[AI]] Flow Execution:** Executed [[AI]] flow for code review, identifying successful elements and planning further enhancements.
- **Maximizing Automatic [[Documentation]]:** Implemented strategies for generating comprehensive automatic documentation across FastAPI projects.
- **Enhanced FastAPI [[Documentation]]:** Updated [[API]] documentation with detailed docstrings and summaries.
- **Generating and Exporting [[API]] [[Documentation]]:** Outlined steps to generate and export [[API]] documentation using FastAPI's built-in tools.

### Achievements
- Fixed debugging issues in FastAPI models.
- Successfully executed [[AI]] flows for code review.
- Improved and exported comprehensive [[API]] documentation.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue enhancing [[AI]] flows and FastAPI models based on identified next steps.
- Harden flows and prepare suggested files for the next MVP milestone.

### Next Steps
- Focus on multi-step [[AI]] flows and UI design for data transformation and enrichment.
