### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore various aspects of [[AI]] development frameworks and MVP templates to enhance development efficiency and innovation.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed a lightweight MVP boilerplate for fast iterations in app development using FastAPI and Next.js.
- Discussed leveraging momentum in MVP development by reusing existing workflows.
- Reflected on the transformation from MVP makers to orchestrators of intelligent systems.
- Explored designing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for [[AI]] systems to enable complex workflows.
- Considered integrating LangChain's [[JSON]] prompt schema for standardization in [[AI]] projects.
- Outlined the vision for [[AI]]-native product creation platforms.
- Examined LangChain's `ChatPromptTemplate` for flexible, modular prompt systems.
- Developed a framework for [[AI]] block orchestration inspired by Next.js and Vercel.
- Discussed the concept of 'Prompt Blocks' as atomic units in [[AI]] workflows.
- Reflected on pioneering in [[AI]] development with multi-prompt execution and modular thinking.
- Reviewed a starter template for creating MVPs with FastAPI and Next.js.
- Reflected on practical learning experiences from building MVPs.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into various [[AI]] development frameworks and MVP templates.
- Identified potential for innovation in [[AI]]-native platforms and prompt engineering.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of DSL design for [[AI]] workflows.
- Implementation of LangChain's [[JSON]] schema in ongoing projects.
- Development of [[AI]]-native product creation tools.
