### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to resolve directory structure mismatches and PYTHONPATH issues in a full-stack setup using Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.

### Key Activities
- Addressed directory structure mismatches when using `create-next-app` by aligning scripts with the generated structure.
- Fixed PYTHONPATH issues with Uvicorn by ensuring commands are run from the project root and suggested creating an alias for convenience.
- Debugged common directory issues in FastAPI applications, focusing on the current working directory and import paths.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` by ensuring the necessary directory structure is created before file creation in FastAPI projects.
- Clarified the confusion between frontend and backend directory structures in full-stack applications.
- Reviewed and corrected a bash script for setting up a full-stack application with proper folder structure and installation instructions.

### Achievements
- Successfully aligned the directory structure for Next.js and FastAPI projects.
- Ensured proper setup and execution environment for Uvicorn with FastAPI.
- Created a comprehensive setup script for full-stack applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the setup script in different environments to ensure compatibility.
- [[Documentation]] of the setup process for team onboarding.
