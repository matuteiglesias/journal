## üìÖ 2025-04-12 ‚Äî Session: Resolved FastAPI 422 Error and Improved API Integration

**üïí 01:20‚Äì01:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Fastapi, Api Integration, Error Handling, Frontend, Backend  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve the `422 Unprocessable Entity` error in a FastAPI application and improve the integration between frontend and backend systems.

### Key Activities
1. **Fixing 422 Error**: Identified the cause of the `422 Unprocessable Entity` error, which was due to the frontend sending a file path instead of file content. Proposed solutions included modifying the frontend to send file content or adjusting the backend to accept file paths.
2. **Frontend Payload Adjustment**: Corrected the frontend payload to ensure compatibility with the backend by sending the correct file path.
3. **File Handling Strategies**: Evaluated strategies for handling file uploads in APIs, considering the pros and cons of sending file paths versus file content.
4. **Flow Execution [[Integration]]**: Integrated a flow execution feature into the Code Review Page using React and TypeScript, with necessary backend adjustments.
5. **Analysis and [[Optimization]]**: Analyzed the `runFlow` function for improvements in error handling and performance.
6. **Model Update**: Updated the FastAPI `FlowRequest` model to handle both `text` and `path` inputs, enhancing error handling.
7. **[[Debugging]]**: Conducted a thorough debugging session to ensure the FastAPI application handles requests correctly, focusing on the `FlowRequest` model.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the `422 Unprocessable Entity` error.
- Improved the integration between frontend and backend systems.
- Enhanced error handling and performance in the [[API]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the updated [[API]] integration to ensure stability.
- Implementation of the selected file handling strategy in production.
