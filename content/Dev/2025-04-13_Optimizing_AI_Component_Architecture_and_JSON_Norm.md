## 📅 2025-04-13 — Session: Optimizing AI Component Architecture and JSON Normalization

**🕒 23:20–23:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: AI, JSON, Pandas, DataFrame, Python, Normalization  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize the architecture of [[AI]] components and address [[JSON]] normalization issues in [[data processing]].

### Key Activities
- Developed a solution for normalizing nested [[JSON]] structures in [[Pandas]] DataFrames.
- Created a reusable [[Python]] function `normalize_component_batch()` for flattening component lists.
- Analyzed and optimized [[AI]] component architecture, focusing on schema-driven design and reusable abstractions.
- Utilized the ComponentPlan table for managing modular [[AI]] development, including test generation and dependency management.
- Structured input for `ai_component_writer` to ensure proper data preparation.
- Provided methods for normalizing nested columns while preserving parent row fields.
- Developed a flexible [[Python]] function for flattening nested [[JSON]] columns.

### Achievements
- Successfully addressed [[JSON]] normalization issues and enhanced [[AI]] component architecture.
- Established a clear pathway for modular [[AI]] development with structured planning and testing.

### Pending Tasks
- Generate auto-tests for [[AI]] components.
- Build a component pipeline and create a manifest for tracking progress.
