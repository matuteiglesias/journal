## 📅 2025-04-13 — Session: Refactored AI System Architecture and Core Modules

**🕒 08:10–08:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: AI, architecture, refactoring, Python, FastAPI  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to review and refactor the [[AI]] interaction architecture and core modules to enhance scalability, maintainability, and modularity.

### Key Activities
- **Architecture Review**: Conducted a detailed review of the existing [[AI]] system architecture, identifying key areas for improvement.
- **Refactoring Plan**: Developed a plan to refactor core [[AI]] modules, focusing on consolidating logic into two main files for better structure.
- **Implementation**: Executed the refactor by implementing changes in the `openai_client.py` and `runner.py` files, enhancing their modularity and scalability.
- **[[API]] Endpoint Creation**: Created an HTTP endpoint in [[FastAPI]] to trigger [[AI]] flows, ensuring seamless integration with the refactored architecture.
- **[[API]] Route Consolidation**: Analyzed and consolidated [[API]] route files into `flow_ui.py` and `flow_api.py` for improved file management.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored core [[AI]] modules, improving code organization and maintainability.
- Established a robust architecture for [[AI]] interaction that supports scalable and maintainable development.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the refactored modules and [[API]] endpoints to ensure stability and performance.
