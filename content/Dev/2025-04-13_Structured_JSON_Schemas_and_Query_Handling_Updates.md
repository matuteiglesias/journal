**üïí 20:50‚Äì21:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Schemas, Automation, Python, Openai, Async  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on enhancing the automation and interoperability of [[AI]] systems through structured [[JSON]] schemas and improving [[Python]] scripts for handling asynchronous queries and data processing.

### Key Activities
- Defined [[JSON]] schemas for component plans and generated components to support automation in [[AI]] systems.
- Designed batch schemas for agent-based code generation, enabling improved performance by handling multiple components per script.
- Corrected [[JSON]] schemas for component plans to ensure valid [[JSON]] structures.
- Developed prompts for ReviewParserAgent and ComponentWriterAgent to facilitate the generation of ComponentPlans and executable code.
- Refactored the `query_openai()` function to handle dynamic fields asynchronously, enhancing flexibility in data processing.
- Troubleshot and resolved issues with [[Pandas]] `to_dict()` method, ensuring proper DataFrame handling.
- Updated OpenAI query functions to transition from string lists to structured records, accommodating multiple fields in input data.

### Achievements
- Established a framework for defining and utilizing structured [[JSON]] schemas in [[AI]] systems.
- Improved the efficiency and flexibility of [[Python]] scripts for asynchronous data processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the updated query functions and [[JSON]] schemas in a live environment.

### Outcome
The session successfully laid the groundwork for more robust and scalable [[AI]] systems through structured data handling and improved code efficiency.
