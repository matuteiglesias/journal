### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the [[AI]] prompt operating system by addressing tactical upgrades, context reconstruction, and onboarding processes for new development agents.

### Key Activities
- **Tactical Upgrade**: Discussed export options for project checklists, focusing on modularity and integration with various formats.
- **Context Reconstruction**: Developed a structured set of questions to aid in reconstructing context and intent for intelligent agent frameworks.
- **Onboarding Briefing**: Prepared a comprehensive onboarding briefing for a new developer, detailing the current development context and immediate goals.
- **Onboarding Tactical Objectives**: Created a checklist for a new agent to develop a prompt OS, including core flow validation and infrastructure setup.
- **Modular [[AI]] Structure Review**: Conducted a structured analysis of an [[AI]] project to identify checklist coverage, immediate TODOs, and next steps, focusing on PromptTracer integration and modular prompt systems.
- **Architectural Analysis**: Analyzed a modular [[AI]] orchestration system, reviewing its structure, abstraction layers, and areas for improvement.

### Achievements
- Established a clear path for integrating modular and pluggable components into the [[AI]] prompt operating system.
- Developed onboarding materials and checklists to streamline new agent integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the identified TODOs from the modular [[AI]] structure review.
- Formalize sequential pipelines and integrate the PromptTracer.
