**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: FastAPI, Summarization, AI Architecture, Bash Scripting, Project Management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to develop a summarization [[API]] using [[FastAPI]] and to outline a modular architecture for prompt-driven applications.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a summarization feature in a [[FastAPI]] application using `PromptCard` abstraction, Pydantic schema, and [[OpenAI]] [[API]].
- Outlined a high-level roadmap for developing a modular app architecture with core components and integration steps for prompt-driven applications.
- Designed a Stack-of-Blocks Interface for [[AI]] prompt pipelines, focusing on UI/UX features and backend mappings.
- Explored the concept of a 'stacked blocks' interface for [[AI]] applications, highlighting unique features.
- Developed [[Python]] and Bash scripts for printing directory trees and backing up files, focusing on project hygiene and architecture cleanup.
- Created a deployment checklist for a fullstack [[AI]] wrapper app, ensuring readiness for deployment.

### Achievements
- Completed the development of a summarization [[API]] and outlined a modular architecture for prompt-driven applications.
- Created scripts for file management and backup, improving project hygiene.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of the 'stacked blocks' interface concept to differentiate new implementations.
- Finalize the deployment checklist items to ensure full readiness.
