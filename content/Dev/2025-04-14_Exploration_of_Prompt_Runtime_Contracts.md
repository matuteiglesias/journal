**üïí 19:20‚Äì20:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, AI Systems, Startup, Business Strategy, Software Architecture  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the concept of Prompt Runtime Contracts and their implications for [[AI]] systems, particularly in the context of [[PromptFlow]] and [[AI]] infrastructure.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the concept of a Prompt Runtime Contract, focusing on its role in ensuring observability, reproducibility, and modularity in [[AI]] systems.
- Emphasized the lack of formal definitions and standards in prompt engineering, highlighting the need for clarity and minimalism in defining protocols for prompt pipelines.
- Outlined a framework for Prompt Runtime Contracts, focusing on modularity, auditability, and reproducibility.
- Structured a layered software architecture for the [[PromptFlow]] project, detailing components like the spec, [[Python]] library, [[FastAPI]] layer, and frontend interface.
- Explored the startup potential of an [[AI]] infrastructure platform with a developer-native prompt runtime.
- Developed a strategic approach for a lean protocol-layer business model for [[PromptFlow]].

### Achievements
- Established a foundational understanding of Prompt Runtime Contracts and their importance in [[AI]] workflows.
- Developed a conceptual framework for implementing these contracts in [[PromptFlow]].
- Identified potential business models and strategic approaches for a startup focusing on [[AI]] infrastructure.

### Pending Tasks
- Further research and development on formalizing Prompt Runtime Contracts.
- Implementation of the proposed software architecture for [[PromptFlow]].
- Exploration of revenue streams and acquisition opportunities for the [[PromptFlow]] startup model.
