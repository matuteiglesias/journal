**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refactor the [[AI]] service architecture and design a modular [[AI]] orchestration system.

### Key Activities
- **[[Refactoring]] [[AI]] Service Architecture:** Focused on decoupling components to enhance reusability and testability. Emphasized separating prompt semantics, LLM communication, and execution logic.
- **Designing Modular [[AI]] Orchestration:** Planned a modular [[AI]] orchestration system using a Prompt Flow OS, detailing core abstractions and integration strategies.
- **YAML-based [[AI]] Prompt Engine:** Created a YAML-based [[AI]] prompt engine compatible with Vertex [[AI]]-style pipelines.
- **Codebase Runner Analysis:** Analyzed different script runners in a codebase and recommended future actions.
- **[[Debugging]] and Fixes:** Addressed various [[Python]] import errors and KeyErrors in pipelines, providing solutions for robust execution.

### Achievements
- Established a structured approach for refactoring [[AI]] service architecture.
- Designed a vision for a modular [[AI]] orchestration system.
- Implemented a YAML-based [[AI]] prompt engine for better compatibility.
- Provided actionable recommendations for codebase runner improvements.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development and testing of the modular [[AI]] orchestration system.
- Implementing logging, caching, and UI improvements for the prompt-chain execution.
