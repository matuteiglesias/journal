**🕒 05:05–05:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, pytest, dependencies, requirements, debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to resolve various [[Python]] module import and dependency issues to ensure smooth execution of the project and its tests.

### Key Activities
- Addressed `PYTHONPATH` issues by providing multiple solutions to ensure [[Python]] can locate the `pipeline_core` package.
- Fixed module import errors related to `openai`, `pandas`, and `DirectoryProcessor` by adjusting path resolutions.
- Provided steps to resolve module import errors focusing on missing dependencies and misrouted imports.
- Resolved pytest test collection issues by addressing missing dependencies and configuration problems.
- Created an initial `requirements.txt` file listing essential and optional packages for the project.
- Identified and listed missing [[Python]] packages to be added to the `requirements.txt` file.
- Guided on installing `faiss-cpu` to resolve `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `faiss` module.
- Debugged test failures by providing specific error fixes, including import errors and function signature mismatches.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved all identified module import and dependency issues.
- Created a comprehensive `requirements.txt` file.
- Ensured all pytest tests are recognized and collected properly.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the project for any new dependency issues that may arise in future development.
