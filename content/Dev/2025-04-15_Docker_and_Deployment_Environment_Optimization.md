### Key Activities
- Improved Docker setup by cleaning up configurations and revising the Dockerfile for both development and production.
- Troubleshot and resolved integration issues between Gunicorn and Uvicorn, ensuring they are installed in the same [[Python]] environment.
- Optimized [[Python]] dependency management by exporting requirements and using tools like pipreqs.
- Cleaned up [[Python]] requirements for a FastAPI application to ensure readiness for Docker and production use.

### Achievements
