**üïí 11:00‚Äì12:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, Integration, Refactoring, OpenAI, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to improve the execution and integration of [[PromptFlow]] with various tools and APIs, focusing on refactoring and resolving issues.

### Key Activities
- **Understanding OpenAIExecutor in [[PromptFlow]]**: Analyzed the OpenAIExecutor class to understand its role in automating [[API]] interactions through YAML.
- **Integrating YAML DAGs with Microsoft [[PromptFlow]]**: Adapted a custom flow-runner architecture to work with Microsoft [[PromptFlow]], enabling seamless execution of prompt steps.
- **Refactoring Prompt Execution Logic**: Reviewed and refactored the prompt execution architecture, transitioning from `PromptCard` to `PromptBlock` for improved Prompty-based flows.
- **Transitioning from PromptCard to PromptyTool**: Made necessary code changes to transition to `PromptyTool`, considering both synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- **Resolving ImportError in [[PromptFlow]]**: Addressed an ImportError related to the PromptyTool, providing recommendations for resolving the issue.
- **Prompty [[Integration]] Improvements**: Identified and corrected issues in Prompty integration, including import statements and environment variable loading.
- **Correcting YAML Configuration for [[OpenAI]] [[API]]**: Modified YAML configuration to switch from Azure [[OpenAI]] to [[OpenAI]].com [[API]], ensuring correctness.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the prompt execution logic and resolved integration issues.
- Improved the configuration and execution of [[PromptFlow]] with external tools and APIs.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the new configurations and integrations to ensure stability.
