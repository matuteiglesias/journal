**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the integration of OpenAPI specifications with Microsoft's [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty for enhanced [[API]] design and prompt engineering.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed early OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications to understand foundational ideas and their evolution.
- Reflected on Swagger 1.2 insights to inform the Prompt Runtime Contract design.
- Reviewed prompt engineering techniques and frameworks, including contributions from major [[AI]] players.
- Evaluated Microsoft's [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty for LLM development and [[AI]] workflows.
- Developed integration plans for [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty into [[Python]] environments.
- Conducted community feedback analysis on [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into the minimalistic beginnings of OpenAPI and its evolution.
- Identified structural and conceptual parallels for Prompt Runtime Contract design.
- Outlined integration steps for [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty in [[Python]] and [[FastAPI]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of unused code highlighting in VS Code and modular systems.
- Complete the transition to [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty, including YAML-based flow migration.

### Outcome
The session successfully explored the integration possibilities and benefits of using OpenAPI specifications with [[PromptFlow]] and Prompty, setting the stage for future development and refinement in [[API]] and prompt management.
