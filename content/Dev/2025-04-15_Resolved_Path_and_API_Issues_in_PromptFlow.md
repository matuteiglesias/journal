**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and resolve various programming issues related to path resolution in [[Python]] scripts and [[API]] connection problems within the [[PromptFlow]] framework.

### Key Activities
- **Path Resolution:** Fixed common path resolution issues in [[Python]] scripts by using absolute references with `Path(__file__).resolve()`.
- **PromptBlock Development:** Created a forward-compatible `PromptBlock` to integrate `.prompty` templates, enhancing [[error handling]] and future-proofing.
- **Promptflow Chat [[API]]:** Resolved role-related formatting errors in `.prompty` files by updating the prompt syntax.
- **[[OpenAI]] [[API]] [[Troubleshooting]]:** Addressed connection issues by correcting the [[API]] URL and ensuring the model parameter is included in requests.
- **YAML Configuration:** Fixed a BadRequestError in YAML configurations by properly placing parameters.
- **[[Debugging]] Techniques:** Implemented [[debugging]] strategies for [[OpenAI]] [[API]] payloads and addressed malformed `base_url` issues.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple path and [[API]] configuration issues, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the [[PromptFlow]] setup.
- Improved the PromptBlock implementation with better [[error handling]] and [[debugging]] capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further enhancements to the PromptBlock for streaming capabilities.
- Continued evaluation and feedback integration for [[PromptFlow]] architecture.
