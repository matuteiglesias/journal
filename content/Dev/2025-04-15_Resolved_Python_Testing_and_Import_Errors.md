## üìÖ 2025-04-15 ‚Äî Session: Resolved Python Testing and Import Errors

**üïí 16:30‚Äì17:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Testing, Error Handling, PromptBlock, PromptFlowRunner  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to address and resolve various [[Python]] testing and import errors, particularly focusing on the `PromptBlock` and `PromptFlowRunner` components.

### Key Activities
- **Testing PromptBlock and PromptFlowRunner**: Validated functionality using [[Python]] test code, ensuring successful execution and exception handling.
- **Test Suite Summary**: Reviewed implemented tests for prompt handling and YAML flow execution, identifying next steps for further testing and refactoring.
- **Fixing PYTHONPATH Issues**: Addressed common issues with pytest not finding local modules by setting PYTHONPATH correctly and ensuring necessary files are in place.
- **ModuleNotFoundError Resolutions**: Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` issues by executing scripts from the project root and adjusting script contents.
- **Import Error Fixes**: Diagnosed and corrected import errors related to `PromptFlowRunner`, ensuring proper import statements and module definitions.
- **Asynchronous Test Fixes**: Refactored async test suite using pytest for proper handling of asynchronous code.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple import and testing errors in [[Python]] scripts.
- Improved the reliability of test suites for `PromptBlock` and `PromptFlowRunner`.
- Enhanced understanding of [[Python]] testing frameworks and [[error handling]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further refactoring of test suites to optimize performance and coverage.
- Continuous monitoring and testing of new code changes to prevent regression issues.
