**üïí 14:30‚Äì15:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI Flows, Debugging, Tracing, React, UX Design  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and design tools for [[debugging]] and tracing in [[AI]] flow environments, focusing on enhancing developer experience and traceability.

### Key Activities
- Reflected on Prompt Flow's observability features and its integration with OpenTelemetry.
- Planned a developer playground UI for [[AI]] flows, emphasizing [[debugging]] and tracing features.
- Designed a portable and modular Trace [[JSON]] schema for improved traceability and UX.
- Outlined the foundational design for an [[AI]] execution runtime with traceable semantics.
- Developed UX design principles for effective trace inspection in development tools.
- Curated a glossary of UX and [[debugging]] terms for flow tools.
- Explored the concept of 'grok' in tech culture, emphasizing intuitive understanding.
- Provided a guide to building a debug playground UI using React, focusing on state management and UI updates.
- Explained the `RunContext.tsx` file for managing global state in React applications.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for developing [[AI]] flow [[debugging]] and tracing tools.
- Created a structured plan for a developer playground UI and Trace [[JSON]] design.
- Enhanced understanding of UX principles for trace inspection and [[debugging]].

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the designed Trace [[JSON]] schema in existing tools.
- Develop the [[AI]] execution runtime with traceable semantics.
- Complete the React-based debug playground UI.
