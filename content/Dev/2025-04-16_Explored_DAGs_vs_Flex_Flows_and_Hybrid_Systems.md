### Session Goal
The session aimed to evaluate different architectural designs in [[AI]] [[workflow]] [[automation]], specifically focusing on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Flex Flows, and hybrid systems involving Prompt and [[Python]] blocks.

### Key Activities
- Evaluated the differences between DAGs and Flex Flows, focusing on aspects like expressiveness, execution control, cognitive load, reusability, and development effort.
- Explored the limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-using agents within DAG frameworks.
- Outlined a conceptual framework for integrating prompt and [[Python]] blocks into a unified system.
- Discussed the Tiny Engine Loop mindset for building modular and composable software.
- Provided guidelines for defining a PythonBlock execution contract.
- Developed strategies for enhancing developer experience in PythonBlocks.
- Emphasized the need for empathetic [[debugging]] tools in [[Python]] development.
- Summarized the architecture of a modular [[OpenAI]] tool adapter for [[PromptFlow]].

### Achievements
- Gained insights into when to use DAGs versus Flex Flows and potential enhancements for DAGs.
- Conceptualized a hybrid system for seamless data flow between prompt and [[Python]] blocks.
- Established best practices for PythonBlock execution contracts and empathetic [[debugging]] tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the suggested enhancements for DAGs to incorporate looping and conditional logic.
- Develop the 'FriendlyErrorCatcher' tool for empathetic [[debugging]].
