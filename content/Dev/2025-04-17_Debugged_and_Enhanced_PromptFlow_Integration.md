**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to debug and enhance the integration of [[PromptFlow]] with OpenTelemetry and improve file management [[automation]].

### Key Activities
- Created essential output files for [[automation]] in the `.runs/{run_id}` directory, including a helper function for file writing.
- Resolved an `AttributeError` in the `PromptBlock` class by initializing the 'prompty' attribute and provided an optional override for flexibility.
- Debugged OpenTelemetry span integration issues, addressing the misuse of the `span` object and the absence of a `.to_dict()` method.
- Successfully implemented [[PromptFlow]]-compatible traces, fully integrated into the trace viewer UI.
- Developed a checklist for evaluating the progress of a PF-compatible MVP, identifying completed tasks and pending items.

### Achievements
- Fixed critical errors in [[PromptFlow]] and OpenTelemetry integration.
- Achieved full integration of traces into the [[PromptFlow]] UI.

### Pending Tasks
- Further improvements in batch execution, file output, tracing, and UI enhancements as outlined in the MVP checklist.
