## 📅 2025-04-17 — Session: Developed 3-Pane Interface and Debugger in Next.js

**🕒 00:45–01:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, PromptFlow, React  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal**: The primary objective of this session was to set up a 3-pane interactive debugger using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN/UI, and to address related frontend and backend integration issues.

**Key Activities**:
1. **Next.js 3-Pane Interface Setup**: A comprehensive guide was followed to build a 3-pane interactive debugger with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN/UI.
2. **Tailwind CSS Configuration Update**: Updated the `tailwind.config.js` file to integrate the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin.
3. **Fullstack [[PromptFlow]]-Compatible App Roadmap**: Outlined a roadmap for developing a fullstack [[PromptFlow]]-compatible application.
4. **Next.js and [[FastAPI]] [[Integration]] Plan**: Developed an implementation plan for integrating Next.js frontend with [[FastAPI]] backend.
5. **Fixing run_id Scope Issue**: Addressed a `NameError` in PromptFlowRunner by ensuring `run_id` is correctly scoped.
6. **Handling Undefined Variable in React**: Resolved an undefined variable warning in a React component by using `useState` and [[API]] calls.

**Achievements**: Successfully set up the 3-pane interface and debugger, updated Tailwind CSS configuration, and resolved key integration and [[error handling]] issues.

**Pending Tasks**: Further development is needed on the fullstack [[PromptFlow]]-compatible application, particularly in backend support and UI refinement.
