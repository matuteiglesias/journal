**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to design and debug a dev-facing [[AI]] workflow tool using FastAPI, focusing on YAML integration and endpoint functionality.

**Key Activities:**
- Designed a UX flow for a dev-facing [[AI]] workflow tool, integrating a live-editable YAML pane with backend/frontend save functionality.
- Conducted a code review of the `Home` component, focusing on YAML improvements and logic enhancements.
- Resolved a FastAPI endpoint issue that returned non-[[JSON]] responses, ensuring valid [[JSON]] output and improved security with file validation.
- Debugged file path resolution issues in FastAPI, addressing 404 errors and ensuring correct YAML file retrieval.
- Provided a troubleshooting guide for the `print()` function not displaying output in FastAPI applications.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented backend and frontend integration for YAML configuration saving.
- Enhanced the `Home` component code with improved logic and YAML handling.
- Fixed [[JSON]] response issues and improved endpoint security in FastAPI.
- Resolved file path issues, ensuring correct YAML file retrieval and handling.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further user feedback mechanisms need to be implemented for the [[AI]] workflow tool to enhance UX.
