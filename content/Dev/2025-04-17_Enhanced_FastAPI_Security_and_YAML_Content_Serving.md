## 📅 2025-04-17 — Session: Enhanced FastAPI Security and YAML Content Serving

**🕒 01:55–02:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Security, YAML, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the security of local development environments using Uvicorn and ensure the [[FastAPI]] backend is effectively serving YAML content for frontend interactions.

**Key Activities:**
- Confirmed [[FastAPI]] backend's capability to serve YAML content, facilitating frontend interactions with YAML data flows.
- Discussed security best practices for local development, focusing on file access and potential vulnerabilities.
- Verified Uvicorn server exposure, ensuring it is securely bound to localhost to prevent unauthorized external access.
- Debugged [[JSON]] parsing errors in [[FastAPI]], addressing issues with [[API]] route registration and frontend queries.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully confirmed the secure configuration of the Uvicorn server, ensuring it is bound to localhost.
- Improved YAML content serving capabilities in [[FastAPI]], enhancing frontend-backend integration.
- Resolved [[JSON]] parsing errors by reviewing and correcting [[API]] route imports and frontend requests.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further improvements in YAML loading and saving mechanisms as suggested during the session.
