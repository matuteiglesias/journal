**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to enhance the development and deployment processes for a Next.js project, focusing on exposing local servers, managing React modules, and improving version control practices.

**Key Activities:**
1. **Exposing Local Servers:** Explored methods to expose local frontend and backend servers using ngrok and alternatives like LocalTunnel and Cloudflare Tunnel. Discussed potential configuration issues and solutions.
2. **React Modules Overview:** Reviewed and categorized installed React modules in a Next.js project, focusing on UI & Styling, React + UI Components, and other utilities.
3. **Prompt Modularization:** Discussed the modularization of prompts for [[AI]] systems using `.prompty` files to enhance user experience and system transparency.
4. **[[Deployment]] Options for Next.js:** Outlined two primary deployment strategies for Next.js: static hosting and full app deployment with [[API]] support. Provided commands and best practices for each.
5. **[[Git]] Management:** Developed a comprehensive `.gitignore` for a project with [[Python]] and Node.js components. Conducted a repository cleanup, applying the `.gitignore`, removing cached files, and committing changes.

**Achievements:**
- Clarified methods for exposing local development servers.
- Categorized React modules for better project organization.
- Established a framework for prompt modularization in [[AI]] systems.
- Defined clear deployment strategies for Next.js applications.
- Improved version control with a tailored `.gitignore` and repository cleanup.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further explore alternatives to ngrok for specific use cases.
- Continue refining [[AI]] prompt modularization strategies.
- Evaluate deployment performance and adjust strategies as needed.
