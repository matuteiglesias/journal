## üìÖ 2025-04-17 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Prompty Endpoint and Debugging Strategies

**üïí 10:30‚Äì11:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Prompty, Fastapi, Debugging, JSON, YAML  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the Prompty endpoint for improved flexibility and debugging, while also addressing various debugging challenges related to [[JSON]] and YAML handling in [[AI]]-driven architectures.

### Key Activities
- **Reverse Engineering**: Explored integration strategies for Prompty with FastAPI, focusing on compatibility and input validation.
- **Critical Analysis**: Evaluated the PromptBlock architecture for modularity and reusability, identifying potential pitfalls and suggesting improvements.
- **[[AI]]-Driven UX Transformation**: Discussed how [[AI]] agents can automate YAML and .prompty file management, enhancing user experience and architecture.
- **Endpoint Enhancement**: Improved the Prompty endpoint's error handling and debugging capabilities, providing a revised code example.
- **[[Debugging]] Techniques**: Addressed [[JSON]] and YAML handling issues, offering structured approaches and collaborative strategies for debugging.

### Achievements
- Successfully confirmed the functionality of the Prompty endpoint, ensuring it operates as expected.
- Developed strategies for improving the PromptBlock architecture and enhancing [[AI]]-driven UX automation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced probing techniques for [[API]]-linked prompts.
- Additional enhancements to the Prompty endpoint for future extensions.
- Continued refinement of [[JSON]] and YAML handling techniques in [[AI]]-driven systems.
