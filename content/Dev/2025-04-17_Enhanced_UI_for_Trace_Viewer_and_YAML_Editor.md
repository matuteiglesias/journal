### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the user interface of a React-based application, focusing on the Trace Viewer and YAML Editor components.

### Achievements

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the UI changes in different environments and screen sizes to ensure consistent performance.
