## 📅 2025-04-17 — Session: Refactored and Debugged FastAPI and React Components

**🕒 02:15–02:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: FastAPI, React, Debugging, Refactoring, Python, JavaScript  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the stability and functionality of various components in a [[FastAPI]] application and address a React component's [[debugging]] issue.

### Key Activities
- **[[FastAPI]] Enhancements**: Refactored `api/main.py` and `api/router.py` to include improved [[error handling]], logging, and CORS settings. This included addressing common import and wiring issues to enhance code structure and stability.
- **Backend Refactoring**: Cleaned and organized `flow_backend.py` for production readiness, focusing on structure, organization, and security.
- **React [[Debugging]]**: Diagnosed and provided a fix plan for a fetch call issue in a React component, addressing problems with an undefined or empty `flowPath` causing malformed requests.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored key components in the [[FastAPI]] application, improving developer experience and application stability.
- Provided a comprehensive guide for [[debugging]] and fixing a React component's fetch call issue.

### Pending Tasks
- [[Integration]] of the refactored backend components with the existing application to ensure seamless functionality.
- Further testing and validation of the React component fix to ensure robustness in various scenarios.
