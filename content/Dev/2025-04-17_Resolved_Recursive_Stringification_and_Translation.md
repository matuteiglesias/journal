## üìÖ 2025-04-17 ‚Äî Session: Resolved Recursive Stringification and Translation Issues

**üïí 12:30‚Äì12:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI, Prompt Engineering, Debugging, Translation, Openai  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve recursive stringification issues in [[AI]] prompt handling and diagnose GPT response format issues in translation prompts.

### Key Activities
- Addressed recursive prompt history contamination in [[AI]] model interactions by providing solutions to clean outputs and avoid storing unwanted message logs.
- Diagnosed issues where GPT mirrored input prompt structure, leading to unexpected stringified responses, and provided solutions for correct output extraction.
- Debugged output extraction logic for GPT responses, focusing on role assumptions and optimizing code for performance.
- Analyzed and corrected a TypeError in method calls.
- Systematically debugged the `translate_back_to_english` function, addressing configuration mismatches and ensuring proper translation functionality.
- Troubleshot OpenAI [[API]] call issues in translation workflows, focusing on differences between Spanish and English translation steps.
- Identified and fixed GPT hallucination issues in message responses.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented solutions for recursive stringification and translation prompt issues.
- Enhanced translation workflow by resolving configuration and [[API]] call issues.
- Improved GPT response handling by addressing hallucination and output extraction problems.

### Pending Tasks
- Further optimization of translation prompt engineering to enhance model performance.
- Continuous monitoring of [[API]] call stability and response accuracy in translation steps.
