## üìÖ 2025-04-18 ‚Äî Session: Architected PromptFlow Engine for AI Workflows

**üïí 18:00‚Äì18:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, architecture, AI workflows, modular design, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to define and outline the architecture of the [[PromptFlow]] Engine, a modular orchestration framework for [[AI]] workflows using YAML-defined flows and reusable building blocks.

### Key Activities:
- **Architecture Definition**: Discussed the architecture of the [[PromptFlow]] Engine, emphasizing its modular design and the use of YAML for defining workflows.
- **Overview and Planning**: Provided an overview of the [[PromptFlow]] architecture, detailing its open-source nature and developer tooling interfaces.
- **Core Architectural Pillars**: Outlined the seven core architectural pillars of [[PromptFlow]], focusing on modularity, composability, and scalability.
- **Script Analysis and Decomposition**: Analyzed and decomposed scripts into executable snippets, aligning them with [[PromptFlow]]'s architectural pillars.
- **Mapping and Execution**: Mapped [[AI]] [[workflow]] scripts to [[PromptFlow]] pillars, highlighting the functionality of each code segment.
- **[[Python]] Block Organization**: Structured shared [[Python]] blocks for clarity and usability within the [[AI]] flow engine.

### Achievements:
- Successfully defined the architecture of the [[PromptFlow]] Engine.
- Mapped [[AI]] workflows and scripts to the core architectural pillars.
- Enhanced the organization of [[Python]] blocks for better [[workflow]] execution.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further refinement of the modular components and interfaces.
- Implementation of suggested refactoring directions for scripts.
- Testing and validation of the [[PromptFlow]] Engine with real-world [[AI]] workflows.
