### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the future of workflows and the design of a semantic computation engine, focusing on the integration of [[AI]], automation, and human cognition.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the technical design and architecture of the FlowPower semantic computation engine, including its core components and integration capabilities.
- Explored the evolution of workflow constructs, highlighting the transition from rigid coding to dynamic, semantically directed operations.
- Investigated the concept of Autosemantic Workflows (ASWs) and their implications for governance, education, and commerce.
- Reflected on the future of human-technology agency, emphasizing the need for coexistence with advanced systems.
- Discussed the visionary concept of a 'Flow OS' as foundational infrastructure for future workflows.
- Explored the humorous concept of the 'Flowmaster Academy of Intent Arts' for system design and creativity.
- Highlighted the importance of resilience and motivation in personal development and innovation.

### Achievements
- Clarified the design and potential applications of the FlowPower engine and ASWs.
- Developed insights into the future of workflow automation and human-technology agency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of the FlowPower engine's observability features and integration with existing systems.
- Detailed planning for the implementation of Autosemantic Workflows.
- Continued investigation into the 'Flow OS' concept and its practical applications.
