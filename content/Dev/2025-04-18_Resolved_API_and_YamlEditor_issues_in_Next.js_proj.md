### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to debug and fix various issues related to [[API]] fetching and component synchronization in a Next.js project, specifically focusing on the YamlEditor component and [[API]] route configurations.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] [[API]] Fetch Issue**: Addressed server port alignment issues between the frontend and backend in a Next.js application.
- **[[API]] Route Structure Fix**: Corrected the [[API]] route structure using the App Router in Next.js, including code examples and structural changes.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] `404` Error**: Followed a checklist to resolve a `404` error for the `/api/list_files` route, ensuring correct file placement and server configuration.
- **Path Resolution Fix**: Identified and resolved a path issue in a Next.js [[API]] route with a code fix.
- **YamlEditor [[Debugging]]**: Fixed file loading issues in the YamlEditor component by checking fetch logic and ensuring component updates.
- **[[API]] Response [[Debugging]]**: Diagnosed and fixed an undefined [[API]] response issue for YAML file fetching, adjusting the App Router and response structure.
- **Editor Synchronization**: Ensured the [[API]] endpoint returns the correct format and synchronized the editor component with its props, including code verification.
- **YamlEditor Component Fix**: Revised the YamlEditor implementation to reflect external value changes without using internal state.
- **[[Refactoring]] YamlEditor**: Refactored the component for controlled and dirty state management, enhancing functionality with code snippets.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[API]] fetch and route issues in the Next.js application.
- Improved the YamlEditor component's functionality and synchronization with [[API]] data.
- Enhanced the overall stability and reliability of the application through refactoring efforts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the YamlEditor component to ensure robustness across different use cases.
- Monitor [[API]] performance and response accuracy in production environments.
