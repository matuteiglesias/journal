**üïí 19:40‚Äì20:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Mit License, Promptflow, Sdk Development, Ai Functions, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the legal and strategic framework for reusing MIT-licensed PromptFlow code in proprietary software development.

### Key Activities
- **Legal [[Strategy]] Framework**: Discussed compliance with MIT licensing requirements and strategies for integrating core functionalities into proprietary software.
- **License Implications**: Clarified that using MIT-licensed code does not necessitate open-sourcing the entire proprietary codebase and provided a structured approach for code organization.
- **SDK [[Development]] [[Strategy]]**: Proposed building a wrapper SDK around Microsoft PromptFlow, focusing on execution and semantic interface differentiation.
- **[[AI]] Function Registry**: Planned the creation of a dynamic [[AI]] function registry in [[Python]], leveraging prompt specifications for seamless integration.
- **[[AI]] Blocks as [[Python]] Functions**: Outlined a guide for creating reusable [[AI]] functionalities in [[Python]], detailing necessary components and architecture.
- **[[AI]] [[Development]] Architecture**: Defined a strategic plan for a lightweight development layer on PromptFlow, including components and implementation roadmap.
- **Callable Prompt Blocks Analysis**: Reflected on the design and performance tradeoffs of implementing callable prompt blocks as [[Python]] functions.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive legal and strategic framework for MIT-licensed code reuse.
- Developed a clear plan for SDK and [[AI]] function registry development.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of innovative features for the SDK to enhance user experience.
- Detailed design and prototyping of the [[AI]] function registry.
