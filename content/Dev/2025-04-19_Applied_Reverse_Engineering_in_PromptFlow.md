**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to deepen the understanding of `run()` functions within the PromptFlow environment, focusing on reverse engineering techniques to enhance future development strategies.

### Key Activities
- Applied reverse engineering techniques to understand the architecture and functionality of `run()` methods.
- Clarified the concept of 'client' in technology, covering [[API]] clients, SDK clients, and client-server architecture.
- Explored the execution logic of PromptFlow, including the `PFClient._run(...)` method.
- Analyzed the Run class in Flowpower, focusing on metadata and execution management.
- Planned a strategic transition to a Tech Lead/Product Engineer role by designing a minimalistic SDK and CLI toolkit for PromptFlow.
- Detailed the orchestration and execution management in PromptFlow, emphasizing integration with Flowpower.
- Examined the `AbstractExecutorProxy` in PromptFlow for executing flows.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into the execution and management of flows within PromptFlow.
- Developed a strategic plan for transitioning to a Tech Lead/Product Engineer role.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the strategic plan for the Tech Lead/Product Engineer role transition.
- Further explore the integration of PromptFlow with other systems for enhanced functionality.
