**üïí 21:00‚Äì21:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flowpower, PromptFlow, CLI, Architecture, SDK, API  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on enhancing the Flowpower project by leveraging insights from [[PromptFlow]] to refine its architecture and developer-facing command-line interface (CLI).

### Key Activities
- **Understanding [[PromptFlow]]'s Streaming:** Explored [[PromptFlow]]'s token-by-token streaming output using server-sent events for real-time user experiences.
- **Strategic Pivot for Flowpower:** Reevaluated the Flowpower architecture to incorporate modular design and feature integration.
- **SDK Design:** Outlined the structure of the `flowpower/sdk/` directory, focusing on user-friendly interfaces.
- **Execution Layer:** Detailed the `engine/` directory's role in managing interactions with [[PromptFlow]].
- **[[API]] Layer Overview:** Transitioned Flowpower to a multi-user platform with REST endpoints and streaming outputs.
- **CLI Overview:** Developed the Flowpower CLI using [[Python]] and Typer, detailing its structure and commands.
- **Project Architecture:** Outlined foundational files and project structure for Flowpower.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compared Typer and Argparse frameworks for CLI development.
- **Final CLI Plan:** Finalized the developer-facing CLI plan, integrating [[PromptFlow]] features.

### Achievements
- Established a clear architectural framework for Flowpower.
- Developed a comprehensive CLI plan that enhances developer experience.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the finalized CLI plan into the Flowpower project.
- Continue refining the [[API]] layer for enhanced streaming capabilities.
