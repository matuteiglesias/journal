### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to analyze the architecture of PromptFlow and explore integration opportunities with FlowPower.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a detailed analysis of PromptFlow's internal architecture, focusing on design patterns and integration opportunities.
- Explored the functionalities of the `Prompty` class and its methods within PromptFlow, examining their implications for FlowPower.
- Developed a structured `_run_prompty` function for executing `.prompty` files using PromptFlow's engine.
- Analyzed the `PromptyExecutor` class to understand its role in integrating Prompty templates into FlowPower.
- Evaluated the `InputDefinition` dataclass from PromptFlow for adaptation into FlowPower.
- Assessed the strategic vision and quality of FlowPower's architecture.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into the key design patterns and integration opportunities within PromptFlow.
- Developed a structured approach for integrating new functionalities into FlowPower.
- Established a foundation for building FlowPower-compatible tools using the `Prompty` class.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development and testing of the integrated functionalities in FlowPower.
- Implementation of the strategic vision for FlowPower's architecture.
