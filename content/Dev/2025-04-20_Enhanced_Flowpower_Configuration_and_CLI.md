### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance the configuration management and CLI setup for the Flowpower project.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed PromptFlow's `_configuration.py` to identify reusable features for Flowpower's `config.py`.
- Planned a production-grade configuration system in [[Python]] with flexibility and minimal dependencies.
- Optimized `__init__.py` files for project-wide imports and CLI integration.
- Diagnosed and resolved Pylance import errors and [[Python]] package issues.
- Addressed `pip install -e .` issues by configuring `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Configured setuptools for a flat package layout and fixed package discovery issues.
- Developed a minimal working example for Flowpower, including CLI entry point setup using Typer.
- Debugged [[Python]] package import issues and fixed CLI subcommand routing in Typer.

### Achievements
- Established a robust configuration system for Flowpower.
- Improved CLI setup and routing, ensuring seamless command execution.
- Resolved multiple packaging and linting issues, enhancing project stability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the CLI entry points and configuration system to ensure reliability across different environments.
