**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to explore and enhance the PromptFlow schema and its tooling capabilities, focusing on YAML configurations, design patterns, and actionable insights for improving Flowpower's developer experience.

### Key Activities
- **FlowBlock SDK Design Blueprint**: Developed a modular system for LLM workflows, including project structure and testing tools.
- **YAML Header Analysis**: Synthesized data model standards for flow-level YAML headers in PromptFlow and AzureML.
- **Schema Overview and Refinement**: Provided a detailed overview and refinement of the PromptFlow YAML header schema using Pydantic.
- **Tooling [[Development]]**: Discussed structured tooling development leveraging PromptFlow's schema for enhanced developer UX.
- **Script [[Development]]**: Outlined a script for aggregating YAML header information.
- **Design Archetypes and Actionable Steps**: Classified PromptFlow designs into archetypes and suggested actionable steps.
- **Advanced Input [[Configuration]]**: Analyzed input configuration patterns for [[Python]] tools.
- **System Insights**: Provided insights into the `chat_with_pdf` system architecture and deployment strategies.

### Achievements
- Created a comprehensive reference for the 'Core + Extended' PromptFlow Header Schema.
- Identified key design patterns and advanced use cases in large `header.yaml` files.
- Developed actionable insights for enhancing Flowpower based on PromptFlow design archetypes.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed structured tools to enhance Flowpower's introspection and developer experience.
- Finalize and test the YAML header aggregation script.
- Further explore advanced input configuration patterns for broader tool applications.
