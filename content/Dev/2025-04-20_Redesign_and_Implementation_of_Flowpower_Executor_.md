**üïí 05:15‚Äì05:30**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Flowpower, Fastapi, Executor, Api Development, Promptflow  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to redesign the Flowpower Executor and implement a modular architecture for it, while also setting up an [[API]] server using FastAPI to enhance its execution capabilities.

### Key Activities
- **Reimagining the Flowpower Executor**: A comprehensive redesign was outlined, focusing on its responsibilities, suggested signatures, and modular dispatch logic to enhance robustness and production readiness.
- **Modular Executor Implementation**: Developed a modular version of the `executor.py` file for the Flowpower architecture, incorporating batch, node, and streaming execution capabilities using `PromptFlow`.
- **[[Debugging]] PromptFlow**: Diagnosed input mapping issues in PromptFlow, providing solutions and suggesting CLI improvements.
- **[[API]] Server Setup**: Demonstrated how to set up an [[API]] server using FastAPI to run flows and trace their execution.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Implemented `endpoints.py` and `chat_adapter.py` for a RESTful and stream-capable application for Flowpower.

### Achievements
- Successfully redesigned and implemented a modular executor for Flowpower.
- Set up a FastAPI server to manage flow execution and trace information.
- Developed RESTful endpoints with streaming capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the redesigned executor and [[API]] server.
- [[Optimization]] of the CLI based on debugging insights.
