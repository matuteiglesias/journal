## üìÖ 2025-04-21 ‚Äî Session: CLI and OpenAI Integration Testing

**üïí 15:50‚Äì16:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: CLI, OpenAI, PromptFlow, Testing, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to test and integrate various CLI flows and [[OpenAI]] [[API]] functionalities, ensuring seamless [[automation]] and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- Conducted battle testing for CLI flows using the `fp` command, focusing on the `basic-with-connection` flow.
- Adapted [[Python]] flow examples for custom repository structures, including dependency installation and environment variable setup.
- Fixed function entry-point test errors by correcting file paths and enhancing test procedures.
- Troubleshot AzureOpenAI endpoint issues, resolving ValueErrors by setting environment variables or refactoring code.
- Refactored [[Python]] scripts to utilize the [[OpenAI]] [[API]], moving away from Azure dependencies.
- Ensured [[PromptFlow]] compatibility with [[OpenAI]] configurations, using YAML schemas for flow definitions.
- Diagnosed and resolved [[OpenAI]] [[API]] 404 errors by verifying SDK usage and environment variables.
- Confirmed successful flow execution, addressing potential token usage issues.
- Tested flex flow commands and evaluated [[PromptFlow]] UI test results for readiness in further development.
- Analyzed [[PromptFlow]] run history for [[optimization]] insights.
- Developed a battle test checklist for async chat flows, focusing on environment setup and [[debugging]].
- Diagnosed and fixed [[OpenAI]] connection issues in [[PromptFlow]], adapting code for [[OpenAI]] [[API]] integration.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated [[OpenAI]] [[API]] with CLI flows, resolving multiple errors and enhancing [[automation]] capabilities.
- Improved the robustness of [[PromptFlow]] setups, ensuring compatibility with [[OpenAI]] configurations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of flow execution to address token usage inefficiencies.
- Continuous monitoring and testing of new CLI and [[API]] functionalities to maintain seamless integration.
