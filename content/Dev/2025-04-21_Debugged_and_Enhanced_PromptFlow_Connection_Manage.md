**🕒 14:30–15:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: PromptFlow, debugging, API, YAML, CLI  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug and enhance the connection management system of [[PromptFlow]], focusing on resolving issues related to Azure [[OpenAI]] [[API]] keys and improving the overall configuration process.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a battle test of the [[PromptFlow]] implementation to identify successes and failures.
- Engaged in forensic [[debugging]] to set up authentication and environment variables correctly.
- Explored [[PromptFlow]]'s connection management system, emphasizing the use of YAML and environment variables.
- Addressed 'Load entity error' by editing YAML files and setting environment variables.
- Resolved [[API]] key issues by providing direct solutions for YAML configuration.
- Reverse-engineered the [[PromptFlow]] CLI connection lifecycle to understand pre-resolved environment variable requirements.
- Investigated [[PromptFlow]] CLI architecture to improve [[debugging]] strategies.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and resolved several connection issues related to [[API]] keys and environment variables.
- Improved understanding of [[PromptFlow]]'s connection management and CLI architecture.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the revised connection management setup to ensure stability.
- Documentation of the [[debugging]] process and solutions for future reference.
