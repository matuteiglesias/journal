### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug and enhance the connection management system of PromptFlow, focusing on resolving issues related to Azure OpenAI [[API]] keys and improving the overall configuration process.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a battle test of the PromptFlow implementation to identify successes and failures.
- Engaged in forensic debugging to set up authentication and environment variables correctly.
- Explored PromptFlow's connection management system, emphasizing the use of YAML and environment variables.
- Addressed 'Load entity error' by editing YAML files and setting environment variables.
- Resolved [[API]] key issues by providing direct solutions for YAML configuration.
- Reverse-engineered the PromptFlow CLI connection lifecycle to understand pre-resolved environment variable requirements.
- Investigated PromptFlow CLI architecture to improve debugging strategies.

### Achievements
- Successfully identified and resolved several connection issues related to [[API]] keys and environment variables.
- Improved understanding of PromptFlow's connection management and CLI architecture.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the revised connection management setup to ensure stability.
- [[Documentation]] of the debugging process and solutions for future reference.
