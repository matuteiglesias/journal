### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to design and implement a custom command-line interface (CLI) for the FlowPower project, leveraging the architectural patterns and functionalities of the [[PromptFlow]] CLI.

### Key Activities
- Designed FlowPower's CLI inspired by [[PromptFlow]], focusing on modularity and user experience.
- Conducted integration testing for the `pf service` command in [[PromptFlow]] CLI to understand its functionality and user experience improvements.
- Explored the structure and components of the [[PromptFlow]] CLI Router for extending functionalities.
- Developed a custom CLI named `flowpower`, integrating and extending existing CLI functionalities.
- Set up a [[Python]] project using Poetry, including configuration and entry point setup in `pyproject.toml`.
- Resolved configuration errors and import issues related to the Poetry project and CLI modules.
- Transitioned from Typer to [[PromptFlow]] CLI, analyzing pros and cons and implementing a unified CLI file.
- Debugged and resolved various CLI-related issues, including import errors, version conflicts, and subcommand visibility.
- Registered an [[OpenAI]] connection in [[PromptFlow]], resolving ConnectionNotFoundError and ensuring proper [[API]] configuration.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a functional FlowPower CLI with integrated extensions and fallback to [[PromptFlow]]'s native CLI.
- Ensured proper handling of subcommands and error resolution in the CLI implementation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further customization of the CLI experience and addressing any remaining environment variable issues.
- Continued integration and testing of [[PromptFlow]]'s CLI functionalities with FlowPower.
