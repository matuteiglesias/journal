### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to diagnose and correct configuration errors in [[PromptFlow]] related to [[OpenAI]] integration.

### Key Activities
- Identified incorrect configurations in `flow.flex.yaml` and `run.yml` files.
- Executed the [[workflow]] successfully, confirming positive results and a functioning system.
- Developed a battle test plan for the minimal chat flow using [[OpenAI]].
- Adapted `flow.py` for [[OpenAI]] [[API]] integration, removing Azure dependencies.
- Provided steps to run chat stream tests and adapted `flow.py` accordingly.
- Fixed a 'KeyError: model_config' in [[PromptFlow]] by updating `flow.flex.yaml`.
- Resolved YAML initialization errors by using `init_kwargs`.
- Validated the `flow.flex.yaml` schema for proper configuration.
- Diagnosed and fixed Marshmallow validation errors in `flow.flex.yaml`.
- Corrected validation errors in `OpenAIModelConfiguration`.

### Achievements
- Successfully diagnosed and fixed multiple configuration issues in [[PromptFlow]].
- Ensured a seamless integration of [[OpenAI]]'s [[API]], enhancing [[workflow]] efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the adapted `flow.py` and chat stream functionalities to ensure robustness.
