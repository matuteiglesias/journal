### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its integration into [[AI]] [[automation]] strategies, including the development of an [[AI]] [[automation]] agency.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an open standard for [[AI]] integration, focusing on scalability, security, and interoperability.
- Discussed the integration of MCP into the Flowpower project to enhance interactions between large language models and external tools.
- Outlined steps to launch an MCP-compliant server using FastMCP, detailing tool exposure for LLMs.
- Explored monetization strategies for [[AI]] [[automation]] using MCP tools.
- Developed an MCP-powered tools module and a modular [[automation]] agency structure using [[PromptFlow]].
- Reflected on the evolution of the Flowpower project and the journey of building an [[AI]] [[automation]] agency.

### Achievements
- Gained a comprehensive understanding of MCP and its potential applications in [[AI]] [[automation]].
- Identified key steps for integrating MCP into ongoing projects like Flowpower.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the MCP-powered tools module and test its integration with existing systems.
- Further develop monetization strategies for the [[AI]] [[automation]] agency.
