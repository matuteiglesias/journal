**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to initialize the AIOS system locally and address any potential issues related to server management and error diagnostics.

### Key Activities
- Successfully launched the AIOS system with all core components operational, including the dogfood_champion agent.
- Discussed common issues with Uvicorn and FastAPI servers not responding to CTRL+C and provided solutions for graceful shutdowns.
- Analyzed system errors in the DogfoodChampion agent, identifying causes and proposing solutions.
- Outlined the design and operational plan for the Dogfeeder agent, focusing on nurturing the Terra ecosystem.
- Developed a robust JSONL reader function in [[Python]] to handle file operations safely.
- Improved file naming conventions in automation scripts for better reliability and stability.

### Achievements
- Successful initialization of the AIOS system.
- Enhanced understanding of server management with Uvicorn and FastAPI.
- Identified and proposed solutions for system errors in the DogfoodChampion agent.
- Planned the Dogfeeder agent's design and operations.
- Created a reliable JSONL reader function.
- Implemented better file naming practices.

### Pending Tasks
- Activate internal flows in the AIOS system once initial testing is complete.
- Finalize and implement the Dogfeeder agent's code and operational steps.
