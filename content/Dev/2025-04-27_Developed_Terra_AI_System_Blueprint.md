**🕒 08:50–09:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Ai_Agents, Terra, Automation, Evolution, Integration  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a comprehensive blueprint for the Terra [[AI]] system, focusing on modular programming, automation, and evolutionary growth.

### Key Activities
- Outlined high-level methods for the DogfoodChampion, emphasizing modular programming for city navigation and daily reporting.
- Developed a template for documentation and ecosystem mapping, prioritizing automation and high-leverage updates.
- Conceptualized the organic evolution of Terra through daily agent outputs, fostering natural selection and historical memory.
- Proposed the 'Terra Git City' concept, where daily artifacts are committed to a Git repository to encourage creativity and evolution.
- Discussed leveraging [[AI]] systems for growth, emphasizing dynamic, self-evolving capabilities.
- Planned an intelligent evolutionary system for Terra, focusing on similarity-based component merging.
- Explored narrative transformation by forking AIOS into Terra, creating a living [[AI]] ecosystem.
- Decided on Terra's development as an independent repository, leveraging AIOS as a foundational layer.
- Outlined integration strategies using AIOS as an external kernel model.
- Planned foundational setup for Terra's usability, minimizing server setup and enhancing user experience.
- Addressed user request management in AIOS, emphasizing client ID requirements for authentication.

### Achievements
- Established a clear blueprint for the Terra [[AI]] system, integrating various innovative concepts and strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed integration strategies and foundational setups for Terra.
- Further develop the narrative transformation and evolutionary models for Terra.
