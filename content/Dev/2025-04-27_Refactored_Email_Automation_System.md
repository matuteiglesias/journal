### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to improve the EmailWatcherAgent class and overall email automation system.

### Key Activities
- **Code Improvements:** Upgraded the EmailWatcherAgent class to accept `triager_agent` and `routing_rules` as parameters, resolving a TypeError and enhancing modularity.
- **[[Debugging]]:** Fixed a TypeError in the `run` method by ensuring `new_emails` are fetched before processing.
- **System Upgrade:** Reviewed and documented the strategic impact of the recent upgrade, focusing on agent modularization and triage-routing flow.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the EmailWatcherAgent class, improving its initialization and functionality.
- Enhanced the modularity and robustness of the email automation system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the upgraded system to ensure stability and performance.
- Implement additional modularization strategies for other components of the email automation system.
