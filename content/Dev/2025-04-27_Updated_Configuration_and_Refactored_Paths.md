### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the configuration management and refactor hardcoded paths in the codebase for the Terra project.

### Key Activities
- Updated `config.py` for better organization and consistency in logging and file management.
- Explored the role of `SEEN_EMAILS_FILE` in email processing to prevent duplicate email handling.
- Provided a guide on using grep commands for identifying file IO operations, aiding in storage and logging redesign.
- Planned and executed the refactoring of hardcoded file paths to use a centralized configuration system, improving maintainability.
- Translated an old YAML configuration into a modern [[Python]] configuration file, emphasizing best practices and security.
- Implemented a structured plan to replace hardcoded paths with configuration variables across various scripts.

### Achievements

- Established a more maintainable and consistent architecture by refactoring hardcoded paths.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new configuration system and refactored paths to ensure seamless integration.
