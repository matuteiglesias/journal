**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive documentation strategy for the Terra system, focusing on both core [[API]] components and other system artifacts.

### Key Activities
- **[[Documentation]] [[Strategy]]**: Established a dual approach, recommending autodocs for core [[API]] components while advocating for handcrafted documentation for artifacts and living systems.
- **Autodocs Plan**: Created a structured plan to generate [[API]] documentation for the `core/` module using pdoc, including installation, folder creation, documentation generation, and local preview steps.
- **pdoc Command Update**: Updated the command usage for the newer version of `pdoc`, which no longer requires the `--html` flag.
- **Name Collision Resolution**: Addressed a name collision issue in pdoc documentation generation by specifying the local folder path.
- **Submodule [[Documentation]] [[Automation]]**: Outlined methods to document all submodules within a top-level [[Python]] package using `pdoc`.
- **FastAPI Autodocumentation [[Troubleshooting]]**: Provided solutions for common issues with pdoc in FastAPI projects, including dependency management.

### Achievements
- Developed a clear and actionable documentation strategy for the Terra system.
- Updated and streamlined the process for generating [[API]] documentation using pdoc.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the autodocs generation plan for the `core/` module.
- Begin crafting the handcrafted documentation for Terra system artifacts.
