### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to draft and organize foundational files and [[documentation]] for the Terra open-source software (OSS) repository.

### Key Activities
- Created essential files for the Terra OSS repository, including `README.md`, `LICENSE (MIT)`, and `setup.py`, ensuring a professional and clean structure.
- Drafted introductory [[documentation]] for the Terra project, covering an overview, installation instructions, and running guidelines.
- Developed a realistic `setup.py` with detailed structure, dependencies, and installation instructions.
- Finalized the dependency list for `setup.py`, including important technical details and notes on deprecated practices.
- Configured a professional-grade `pyproject.toml` for the Terra project, detailing dependencies and installation instructions.
- Included non-code folders in [[Python]] packaging using a `MANIFEST.in` file.
- Organized project [[documentation]], planning to move it from a [[Python]] SDK project to a [[Docusaurus]] frontend.
- Created a [[Docusaurus]] setup checklist to ensure successful migration and setup.

### Achievements
- Successfully drafted and organized foundational files and [[documentation]] for the Terra OSS repository.
- Ensured all necessary files and folders are included in the [[Python]] package.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the [[Docusaurus]] setup and ensure the [[documentation]] is correctly displayed and organized.
