**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to diagnose and fix various function call and template rendering issues in the AIOS and [[Python]] environments.

### Key Activities
- Triggered a function call in LLMQuery to enforce schema validation.
- Diagnosed a validation error in AIOS related to tool calls and provided a corrected approach.
- Fixed a server function call error by ensuring proper internal mappings in AIOS.
- Corrected function call syntax for LLM queries, emphasizing the inclusion of empty arguments.
- Addressed [[API]] request errors by ensuring the 'arguments' field was present in function calls.
- Corrected [[JSON]] structure for function calls, ensuring proper nesting of 'arguments'.
- Adapted new data schema for DemoAgent, updating documentation templates.
- Fixed template rendering issues in [[Python]] loops by correctly extracting parameters.
- Provided a solution for flattening nested lists in [[Python]] using list comprehension.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple errors related to function calls and template rendering.
- Improved the robustness of function call handling in both AIOS and [[Python]] environments.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the corrected function call structures in a live environment to ensure stability.
