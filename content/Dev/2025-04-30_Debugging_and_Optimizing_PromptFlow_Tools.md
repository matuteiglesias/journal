## üìÖ 2025-04-30 ‚Äî Session: Debugging and Optimizing PromptFlow Tools

**üïí 06:50‚Äì08:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, Debugging, Logging, Optimization, Python, Node Execution  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to debug and optimize the [[PromptFlow]] tools and workflows, focusing on improving logging, output management, and node execution.

### Key Activities
- Inspected intermediate values in [[PromptFlow]] [[Python]] tools and explored alternative logging strategies.
- Managed [[PromptFlow]] run artifacts, identifying key files and folders for [[debugging]].
- Analyzed execution logs for `my_python_tool`, recommending updates to logging and [[error handling]].
- Fixed output declaration issues in the `filter_llm` node and corrected YAML outputs section.
- Diagnosed truncated outputs in `outputs.jsonl` and provided a fix plan.
- Confirmed pipeline functionality and node execution for `filter_llm`, `filter_prompt`, and `match_prompt` nodes.
- Optimized signal-to-noise ratio in `match_llm` prompts.
- Enhanced review agent prompt templates for strategic evaluation.

### Achievements
- Improved logging and [[error handling]] strategies for [[PromptFlow]] tools.
- Successfully executed and debugged multiple nodes within the [[PromptFlow]] setup.
- Developed enhanced templates for review agents, focusing on strategic evaluation.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the recommended updates to logging and [[error handling]] in `my_python_tool`.
- Continue refining prompt structures for clarity and efficiency.
