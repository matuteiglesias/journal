### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design a strategic human+[[AI]] decision system focusing on job intake, matching, and proposal drafting, with an emphasis on modularity and human involvement.

### Key Activities
- Outlined a structured 3-stage pipeline for a cooperative human+[[AI]] decision system.
- Designed a [[JSON]]-based Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for processing job listings through a three-stage [[workflow]] to aid freelance developers.
- Provided a step-by-step guide for executing a flow using the `flow-yaml-generator` tool from the command line.
- Offered a detailed breakdown of the `flow.dag.yaml` definition, including its structure and suggestions for improvements.
- Explained output mapping for the `flow-yaml-generator` tool, including a quick fix recipe.

### Achievements
- Successfully planned a comprehensive [[workflow]] for a human+[[AI]] decision system.
- Developed a command-line execution guide for a flow management tool.
- Improved understanding of DAG definitions and output mappings.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the designed [[workflow]] in a real-world scenario.
- Test the flow-yaml-generator tool with the new mappings and definitions.
