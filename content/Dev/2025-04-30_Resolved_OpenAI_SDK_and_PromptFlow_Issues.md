**🕒 04:30–05:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Openai Sdk, Promptflow, Python, Error Handling, Configuration  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to address and resolve various errors and configuration issues related to the OpenAI SDK and PromptFlow.

### Key Activities
- Fixed a TypeError in the OpenAI SDK Client Initialization by removing the unexpected 'proxies' argument in the `get_client()` function.
- Corrected the client instantiation in `llm_interaction.py` to avoid using a connection dictionary that included unwanted proxies.
- Created a minimal working PromptFlow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with specified nodes and configurations.
- Corrected YAML configuration for PromptFlow to align with a reference structure.
- Updated the OpenAI SDK Client to ensure compatibility with SDK version >= 1.0.0.
- Resolved a TypeError related to compatibility issues between the `openai` package and `httpx` library by providing solutions such as upgrading or downgrading the packages.
- Addressed invalid [[JSON]] format in LLM output to ensure proper [[JSON]] structure.
- Updated and adapted the `submission_handler.py` to handle plain text outputs, simplifying the process and including fallback mechanisms.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed and updated the OpenAI SDK and PromptFlow configurations.
- Improved error handling and compatibility for various [[Python]] libraries.

### Pending Tasks
- No pending tasks were identified; all issues were resolved during the session.
