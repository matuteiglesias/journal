**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to design, correct, and execute a [[Python]] script and related configuration files for [[PromptFlow]] to manage job [[data processing]] and [[automation]].

### Key Activities
- Designed the `submission_handler.py` script to organize and save artifacts from a review process.
- Fixed the `submission_handler.py` to include the necessary `@tool` decorator for [[PromptFlow]] compatibility.
- Diagnosed and resolved a runtime error in [[PromptFlow]] caused by data mismatch issues.
- Set up and configured `run.yml` and `column_mapping` for effective job data management.
- Cleaned and deduplicated a job listing dataset for use in [[PromptFlow]].
- Created a valid `run.yml` file to resolve errors and ensure proper execution.
- Corrected configuration files `flow.dag.yaml` and `run.yml` for job [[data processing]].
- Addressed and resolved [[PromptFlow]] UserErrorException by specifying correct flow directory.
- Fixed and clarified the use of [[PromptFlow]] CLI commands for proper flow execution.

### What was Achieved
- Successfully designed and fixed the `submission_handler.py` script.
- Resolved runtime errors and UserErrorExceptions in [[PromptFlow]].
- Configured and executed [[PromptFlow]] with corrected YAML files and CLI commands.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[PromptFlow]] setup with additional datasets.
- Continuous monitoring for any new errors or issues during execution.
