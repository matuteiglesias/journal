## 📅 2025-05-01 — Session: Refactored Email Processing System

**🕒 19:45–23:53**  
**🏷️ Labels**: email processing, automation, modularity, Python, architecture  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the email processing system by implementing modularity, improving architecture, and ensuring efficient email handling.

### Key Activities
- Defined and normalized the `bibliotecas` table in DBML.
- Planned and outlined high-leverage milestones for [[workflow]] [[optimization]].
- Developed a structured Pomodoro [[strategy]] for technical milestones.
- Introduced Notion for [[AI]] operations [[documentation]].
- Detailed a task breakdown for an email [[automation]] system.
- Analyzed and designed the architecture for an email intelligence [[automation]] system.
- Implemented the `EmailParser` class and refactored it for modularity and readability.
- Developed the `EmailOrchestrator` class for fetching, parsing, and storing emails.
- Explored stored email data using [[Python]] and pandas.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored the email parser and orchestrator for improved modularity and functionality.
- Established a robust architecture for the email processing lifecycle.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the triage phase in email orchestration to enhance modular design and avoid coupling chaos.
