### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug various issues related to LLM tool calls and [[FastAPI]] endpoints to enhance system reliability and performance.

### Key Activities
- **[[Debugging]] LLM Tool Call Failures:** Addressed timeout errors and NoneType result crashes by implementing better [[error handling]].
- **Diagnosing Local [[AI]] Kernel Issues:** Conducted a step-by-step diagnostic process to troubleshoot local [[AI]] kernel issues using [[FastAPI]] and Uvicorn.
- **[[Debugging]] [[FastAPI]] Queries:** Created a checklist for [[debugging]] [[FastAPI]] query and POST request issues, including endpoint binding and [[OpenAI]] [[API]] call diagnostics.
- **Resolving [[FastAPI]] Route Conflicts:** Identified and resolved conflicting route definitions in [[FastAPI]] applications.
- **Fixing LLMToolAgent Class:** Corrected the LLMToolAgent class to ensure proper argument parsing and [[error handling]].
- **Reflection and Action Guide:** Summarized accomplishments and outlined next steps for continued improvements.

### Achievements
- Enhanced [[error handling]] for LLM tool calls.
- Improved diagnostic processes for [[FastAPI]] and local [[AI]] kernel issues.
- Corrected and optimized the LLMToolAgent class functionality.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the outlined next steps for [[automation]] projects, focusing on the Email Agent.
- Continue refining the Upwork funnel for efficiency improvements.

### Outcomes
The session successfully addressed multiple [[debugging]] issues, improving the robustness of the LLM tool call architecture and [[FastAPI]] applications.
