## 📅 2025-05-02 — Session: Developed and Enhanced Email Management System

**🕒 00:20–01:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Email Processing, Automation, Logging, Python, Bash  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance and develop a robust email management system with a focus on modularity, logging, and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- **Explored the use of Salbutamol**: Briefly reflected on the use of Salbutamol for coughs related to respiratory issues.
- **Outlined a Modular Email Processing System**: Discussed the architecture and principles of a modular email processing system, emphasizing scalability and separation of concerns.
- **Implemented Structured Logging**: Added structured logging to various components of the email management pipeline, including the `TriageStateManager` and email parsing methods.
- **Developed Email Pipeline Demo Suite**: Planned a demo suite to showcase the email processing system's functionalities.
- **Implemented `load_all_emails()` Method**: Developed the `load_all_emails()` method in the `EmailStorageManager` class to handle email loading and error management.
- **Bash Scripting**: Created a bash one-liner to list recently modified files within a directory.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented structured logging across multiple components, enhancing traceability and debuggability.
- Developed a method for loading emails, improving the email management system's robustness.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the email processing system's components are required to ensure full functionality and reliability.

### Labels
- Email Processing, [[Automation]], Logging, [[Python]], Bash
