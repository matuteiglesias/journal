## 📅 2025-05-02 — Session: Enhanced Error Handling and Timeout Management

**🕒 01:20–02:10**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Error Handling, Timeout, Ai Kernel, LLM, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve error handling and timeout management in various systems, including email triage and [[AI]] kernel servers.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed error traces in the email triage system to identify causes of timeouts and failures.
- Developed a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve timeout issues in [[AI]] kernel servers.
- Implemented fixes for [[JSON]] output in chat functionalities and reconstructed debugging sessions for better structured output.
- Standardized LLM tool-call interactions and addressed timeout issues in function calls.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of agent architectures, leading to recommendations for unification.
- Streamlined the `dogfood_champion.py` script for better performance.
- Designed a general LLM Tool Agent pattern and implemented a unified `EmailTriagerAgent` class.

### Achievements
- Enhanced fault tolerance and robustness in email triage and [[AI]] kernel systems.
- Improved [[JSON]] output handling in chat functionalities.
- Established best practices for LLM tool-call interactions.
- Successfully unified agent architectures for better code reuse and efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of implemented changes in production environments.
