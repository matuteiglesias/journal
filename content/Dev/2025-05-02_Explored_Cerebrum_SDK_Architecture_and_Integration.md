## 📅 2025-05-02 — Session: Explored Cerebrum SDK Architecture and Integration

**🕒 21:35–22:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Cerebrum SDK, AI Agents, Integration, Modularity, Agent Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to explore and understand the architecture and integration capabilities of the Cerebrum SDK, focusing on its modular design, orchestration layer, and agent management.

### Key Activities
- Reflected on the architecture and capabilities of the Cerebrum SDK, including its modular design and integration with external runtimes.
- Reviewed the orchestration layer of the SDK, emphasizing its composability and reusability.
- Examined the ConfigManager for configuration management using a singleton pattern.
- Discussed a compact packaging system for agents and tools, enhancing portability.
- Analyzed the core logic of agent management, including packaging, uploading, and caching.
- Explored the `load_agent()` method for loading [[AI]] agents.
- Compared Cerebrum with [[PromptFlow]], highlighting integration strategies.
- Investigated the integration of [[PromptFlow]] DAGs with Cerebrum agents.
- Introduced the `AutoTool` class for tool management.
- Explored the CLI and execution entry point of the SDK.

### Achievements
- Gained comprehensive insights into the Cerebrum SDK's architecture and its orchestration capabilities.
- Identified key integration patterns with [[PromptFlow]] for enhanced [[workflow]] orchestration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of the `AutoTool` class for advanced tool management.
- Implementation of identified integration patterns in a test environment.
