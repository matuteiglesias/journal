**üïí 04:10‚Äì04:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Promptflow, Job Funnel, Automation, Data Validation, Observability  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to troubleshoot and enhance various processes related to PromptFlow and Job Funnel, focusing on data validation, observability, job proposal evaluation, and automation of reporting tasks.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] PromptFlow Data Mapping Errors**: Addressed issues with missing fields in `job_data.jsonl` by verifying and correcting the data structure.
- **PromptFlow Observability**: Explored a comprehensive guide for inspecting and auditing observability data, detailing five layers of analysis.
- **Job Funnel Run Summary and Proposal Evaluation**: Evaluated a job funnel run, including a successful status and recommendations for job proposal submission.
- **Generating Informative Post-Run Artifacts**: Planned the creation of post-run artifacts for observability and tracking, detailing inputs and outputs for reports.
- **Structured Analysis of Job Funnel Input**: Analyzed job funnel input instances, outlining structural components and intelligence derived from each stage.
- **Job Enrichment [[Pipeline]] and Markdown Generation**: Developed a pipeline for enriching job entries and generating Markdown reports using Jinja2 templates.
- **Transforming [[JSON]] Array to JSONL Format**: Provided a [[Python]] script to convert [[JSON]] arrays to JSONL format for use in LLM pipelines.
- **Demand Analysis for [[Automation]] and [[AI]] Roles**: Reflected on demand patterns in automation engineering and [[AI]] operations, providing strategic insights.

### Achievements
- Resolved data mapping errors in PromptFlow.
- Enhanced observability and reporting processes.
- Evaluated and strategized job funnel proposals.
- Developed automation scripts for data transformation.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the job enrichment pipeline in production.
- Further refine the [[JSON]] to JSONL conversion script for efficiency.
- Continue monitoring demand trends in [[AI]] and automation roles.
