### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to debug and enhance the configuration of LLMs in the AIOS kernel to ensure smooth operation and integration.

### Key Activities
- **Debugged LLM [[Configuration]]**: Addressed a critical issue where no LLM backend was configured, leading to silent failures. Provided steps to fix the configuration by explicitly providing the `llms` argument from the YAML config or hardcoding it for testing.
- **Enhanced Observability**: Improved the `send_request` function with enhanced logging capabilities for better observability and traceability.
- **Kernel [[Configuration]] [[Debugging]]**: Addressed a 500 Internal Server Error due to misconfiguration in the kernel. Provided steps to correctly register the LLM in the kernel config.
- **AIOS Kernel Validation**: Confirmed the AIOS kernel is functioning correctly and provided guidance on testing the query payload while addressing schema validation errors.
- **LLM Recognition Fix**: Resolved an issue where the AIOS kernel did not recognize the `gpt-4` model, including necessary configuration changes.
- **YAML [[Configuration]] Issue**: Identified and resolved a mismatch between the agent call and the defined model in the YAML configuration.
- **Tool Hub Error Resolution**: Resolved a tool hub error encountered in an OpenAI model setup related to the `demo_author/arxiv` tool.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and enhanced the configuration of LLMs in the AIOS kernel.
- Improved error handling and observability in the system.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the AIOS kernel with additional payloads to ensure robustness.
- Continuous monitoring of the system for any new configuration issues.
