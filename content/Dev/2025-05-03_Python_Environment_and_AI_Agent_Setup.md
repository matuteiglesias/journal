## 📅 2025-05-03 — Session: Python Environment and AI Agent Setup

**🕒 03:10–03:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, AI Agents, Cerebrum SDK, Environment Setup, Dependency Management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to resolve [[Python]] environment issues, set up [[AI]] agent dependencies, and enhance the Cerebrum SDK integration.

### Key Activities
- Inspected and fixed [[Python]] module search paths and import path issues.
- Diagnosed [[Python]] environment setup, focusing on dependency management with `pydantic`.
- Installed and configured AIOS Kernel dependencies to ensure compatibility.
- Set up Gradio demos using the Cerebrum SDK, avoiding the full AIOS stack.
- Installed PyYAML for YAML support and updated requirements for future installations.
- Resolved [[Python]] virtual environment conflicts and ensured proper package installations.
- Refactored `AutoTool` implementation and integrated it into `TestAgent`.
- Explored Cerebrum SDK reference implementation and local agent loading with `AgentManager`.
- Developed workflows for tool management in Cerebrum/AIOS and scaffolded CLI for tool validation.
- Reviewed CLI-based agent execution and planned system testing and deployment.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved [[Python]] environment and import issues.
- Established a clean and compatible setup for [[AI]] agent development and deployment.
- Enhanced Cerebrum SDK integration and tool management workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the refactored `AutoTool` and `TestAgent` integration.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of [[Python]] dependencies to prevent future conflicts.
