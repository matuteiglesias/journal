The primary goal of this session was to resolve various [[Python]] packaging and pathing issues encountered during the installation and testing of the Cerebrum SDK and related [[Python]] modules.

### Key Activities
- **SDK Installation Issues**: Addressed the failure of the `aios-agent-sdk` package installation by providing alternative installation methods.
- **[[Python]] Package Installation Error**: Created a minimal `pyproject.toml` file to fix installation errors for the 'cerebrum' folder.
- **Installation Path Fix**: Corrected the installation path by installing from the parent directory.
- **Multi-Module Packaging**: Used setuptools to handle multiple top-level modules in a [[Python]] project.
- **Local Testing of DemoAgent**: Conducted local tests and provided troubleshooting steps for DemoAgent.
- **[[Python]] Pathing Issues**: Suggested solutions for fixing import path issues in [[Python]] scripts.
- **[[Jupyter]] Notebook Setup**: Configured [[Jupyter]] Notebooks for proper module imports by adjusting `sys.path`.
- **ImportError Fixes**: Resolved ImportError issues for DemoAgent and other modules by correcting import paths.

### Achievements
Successfully resolved multiple [[Python]] packaging and pathing issues, ensuring smooth installation and execution of the Cerebrum SDK and related modules.

### Pending Tasks
