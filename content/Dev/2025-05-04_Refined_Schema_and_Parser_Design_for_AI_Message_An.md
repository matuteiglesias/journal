## 📅 2025-05-04 — Session: Refined Schema and Parser Design for AI Message Annotation

**🕒 17:20–18:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: schema design, AI parsing, message annotation, workflow improvement, parser enhancements  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine the schema and parser design for [[AI]] message annotation, focusing on enhancing the structure and classification of parsed messages to improve [[workflow]] efficiency and message reusability.

### Key Activities
- Discussed strategies for reviewing [[AI]] interactions to improve workflows.
- Outlined an initial parser plan for [[AI]] message annotation, including preprocessing, classification, and tagging phases.
- Proposed enhancements for parser design by identifying additional dimensions such as response category and technical depth.
- Finalized the schema for Phase 1 Parser, detailing structure and classification of parsed messages.
- Developed a schema refinement plan based on new samples, suggesting hierarchical tagging and additional fields.
- Worked on schema for classifying technical messages generated by ChatGPT.
- Proposed a version 2 of the `ParsedMessage` schema to capture message diversity and richness.
- Explained the `content_medium` field for content categorization in software development.
- Provided a specification for structural fields in message parsing.
- Defined a refined schema for `ParsedMessage` to facilitate retrieval and classification.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive plan for refining and enhancing the [[AI]] message annotation schema and parser design.
- Created detailed specifications and templates for various aspects of the parser design.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the refined schema and parser enhancements in the actual system.
- Test the new schema and parser design with real-world data to validate improvements.
