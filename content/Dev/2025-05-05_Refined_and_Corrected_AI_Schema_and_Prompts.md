## 📅 2025-05-05 — Session: Refined and Corrected AI Schema and Prompts

**🕒 04:00–04:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: schema, AI, prompt, OpenAI, modular, function-calling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The objective of this session was to refine and correct various [[AI]] schemas and prompts to enhance modularity, compliance, and functionality.

### Key Activities
- **Modular Schema Breakdown**: Developed a modular schema for annotation, separating fields into basic and advanced layers for flexibility and potential monetization.
- **Refined System Prompt**: Created a refined system prompt for a screening agent, detailing responsibilities and output rules for structured metadata generation.
- **Condensed System Prompt**: Streamlined the system prompt for core responsibilities and output requirements.
- **Correction of Minimal Schema**: Provided corrections to a minimal schema for [[OpenAI]] function-calling, emphasizing the necessity of a `parameters` wrapper.
- **Fixed `parsed_message` Schema**: Corrected the `parsed_message` schema to comply with [[OpenAI]]'s function-calling format.

### Achievements
- Successfully created modular and refined schemas and prompts.
- Ensured compliance with [[OpenAI]] function-calling conventions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the refined schemas and prompts in real-world scenarios.
