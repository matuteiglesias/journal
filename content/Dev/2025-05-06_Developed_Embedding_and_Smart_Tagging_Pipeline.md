## 📅 2025-05-06 — Session: Developed Embedding and Smart Tagging Pipeline

**🕒 17:00–17:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: embedding, data processing, Python, automation, metadata  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the [[data processing]] pipeline by developing embedding, smart tagging, and storage solutions.

### Key Activities
- Outlined the next steps in the [[data processing]] pipeline, focusing on merging daily logs, embedding for semantic search, and implementing smart tagging and storage solutions.
- Developed a robust merge [[strategy]] for log files using [[Python]] scripts, which included merging original log files with screening results.
- Created a flattened script for merging JSONL files, ensuring the original structure is retained and including a `screening_result` field.
- Designed an embedding and metadata indexing pipeline using merged JSONL files, detailing steps for text extraction, metadata preparation, embedding computation, and storage in a vector database.
- Implemented a full pipeline for merging logs and embedding, storing results in ChromaDB with a JSONL backup.
- Set up an incremental embedding system in [[Python]] using Langchain, including package installation and environment verification.
- Developed an embedding pipeline for merged logs, extracting relevant content and saving it into a vector store.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and tested a comprehensive embedding and smart tagging pipeline ready for vectorization, including enhancements like skipping already embedded chunks and utilizing [[OpenAI]] embeddings with rich metadata tracking.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and [[optimization]] of the pipeline for production use.
- Exploration of potential user interface options for enhanced search and retrieval of annotated data.
