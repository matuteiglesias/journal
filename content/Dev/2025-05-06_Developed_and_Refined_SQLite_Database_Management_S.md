## 📅 2025-05-06 — Session: Developed and Refined SQLite Database Management Scripts

**🕒 20:20–21:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Sqlite, Python, Database, Automation, Error Handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to develop and refine [[Python]] scripts for managing an SQLite database that stores assistant messages.

### Key Activities
- **SQLite Connection Handling:** Implemented a corrected version of [[Python]] code for connecting to an SQLite database and safely querying assistant messages.
- **Inserting Assistant Messages:** Developed a function to insert only 'assistant' messages into the database, avoiding duplicates and skipping non-assistant messages.
- **Filtering Messages:** Ensured that only assistant messages are stored by addressing potential issues with existing entries and providing solutions for filtering and resetting the database.
- **Database Reset Script:** Created a [[Python]] script to reset the database by dropping the existing 'messages' table and creating a new one.
- **Modular Ingestion [[Pipeline]]:** Proposed a structure for an ingestion pipeline with a controlled reset mechanism, message filters, and daily JSONL exports.
- **[[Error Handling]] Improvements:** Fixed [[JSON]] vs JSONL parsing errors and addressed a Jupyter runtime file error.
- **Function Correction:** Provided a corrected version of the `extract_messages()` function for accurate message filtering.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed scripts for database management, ensuring robust insertion, filtering, and resetting mechanisms.
- Enhanced error handling for [[JSON]] and JSONL file parsing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the ingestion pipeline structure and error handling improvements in a production environment.
