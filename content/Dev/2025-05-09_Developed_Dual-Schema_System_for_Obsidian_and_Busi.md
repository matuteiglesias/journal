### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and refine a dual-schema system for use in Obsidian and business intelligence applications, focusing on metadata management and [[automation]].

### Key Activities
- Explored the role of tags and classification in organizing assistant responses.
- Planned and outlined a dual-layer classification system for knowledge management in Obsidian.
- Developed a unified schema for note generation, emphasizing field consolidation.
- Created detailed [[JSON]] schemas for metadata extraction in business and product intelligence.
- Implemented Jinja2 prompt templates for screening contexts.
- Outlined dual-schema outputs for Obsidian and business intelligence workflows.
- Updated scripts for merging enriched files and transitioning to a flat directory structure for Markdown exports.
- Enhanced [[Python]] scripts for handling flattened [[JSON]] structures and metadata injection.
- Improved metadata retrieval methods in ChromaDB.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed a dual-schema system that integrates with both Obsidian and business intelligence workflows.
- Enhanced existing [[Python]] scripts to accommodate new metadata structures.
- Improved metadata handling and retrieval efficiency in ChromaDB.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the dual-schema system in real-world scenarios.
- Continued refinement of metadata management processes.
- [[Integration]] of enhanced metadata retrieval methods into broader workflows.
