**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Gradio, RAG, Knowledgebasesync, Chromadb, Modulardesign  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design a modular `KnowledgeBaseSync` component for a Gradio RAG application, focusing on efficient synchronization with ChromaDB.

### Key Activities
- Outlined the design and implementation details for the `KnowledgeBaseSync` component.
- Explored open-source tools for document ingestion and integration with vector databases.
- Reviewed the Apache License 2.0 to ensure legal compliance in software development.
- Discussed the transition from open source to productization, emphasizing ethical practices.

### Achievements
- Developed a clear design for the `KnowledgeBaseSync` component, ensuring modularity and separation from the Gradio app's UI.
- Gained insights into open-source tools and frameworks for knowledge management.
- Clarified legal aspects of using the Apache License 2.0 in product development.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of ethical considerations in building on open-source systems.
- Implementation of the `KnowledgeBaseSync` component in the Gradio RAG app.
