### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop and refine a data processing pipeline for exporting `.jsonl` logs into an Obsidian vault, enhancing note organization and retrieval.

### Key Activities:
- Reviewed progress from the RAG App sprint, identifying deferred issues for future attention.
- Updated the checklist for ongoing RAG app development tasks.
- Verified file paths for JSONL logs and addressed error handling in the markdown export pipeline.
- Planned the data processing pipeline to convert `.jsonl` logs into a structured Obsidian vault, including YAML metadata and backlinking strategies.
- Implemented [[Python]] functions for loading and normalizing `.jsonl` chat logs.
- Executed the second stage of the Obsidian export pipeline, focusing on exporting notes to Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
- Generated a checklist for exporting Markdown notes to Obsidian, suggesting next steps for improved organization.
- Developed [[Python]] scripts for automating the creation of Daily Index files and a Global Map of Content (MOC) in Obsidian.

### Achievements:
- Successfully outlined and partially implemented the pipeline for JSONL to Obsidian export.
- Enhanced error handling and file path verification processes.

### Pending Tasks:
- Resolve the issue of the missing JSONL file to complete the export pipeline.
- Further refine the Obsidian export process and enhance note organization features.
