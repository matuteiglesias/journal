## üìÖ 2025-05-11 ‚Äî Session: Developed RAG Mini-Suite and Addressed API Limitations

**üïí 14:00‚Äì15:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: RAG, Openai, API, Development, Gradio, LSFA 2025  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to advance the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mini-suite and address limitations in using OpenAI's Assistants [[API]] for document management.

### Key Activities
- **LSFA 2025 Contribution Planning**: Explored potential contributions to the LSFA 2025 conference, focusing on Mat√≠as' expertise in semantic pipelines and formal logic.
- **RAG Mini-Suite [[Development]]**: Outlined a roadmap for the RAG mini-suite, including MVP completion and productization steps.
- **Gradio UI Module Implementation**: Developed a `rag_ui.py` module for Gradio, integrating context retrieval and LLM-based question answering.
- **[[Python]] UI Fixes**: Resolved tab configuration issues and implemented the missing `get_ui()` function in the RAG UI.
- **OpenAI [[API]] [[Integration]]**: Updated the `run_llm()` function for OpenAI [[API]] version 1.0.0 and optimized retrieval strategies using the Assistants [[API]].
- **Assistants [[API]] Enhancements**: Implemented a starter script for the RAG pipeline and updated tool types, replacing deprecated 'retrieval' with 'file_search'.
- **Scaling and File Management**: Addressed file attachment limits in the Assistants v2 [[API]] and proposed a hybrid RAG approach using a vector database.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented the Gradio UI module and resolved configuration issues.
- Updated OpenAI [[API]] integration to comply with new standards.
- Developed strategic options for document retrieval using RAG and OpenAI Assistants.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the productization phase of the RAG mini-suite.
- Implement the proposed hybrid RAG approach using a vector database for document management.
- Explore further contributions to LSFA 2025, focusing on networking and presentation opportunities.
