## 📅 2025-05-11 — Session: Implement and Debug Gradio UI Enhancements

**🕒 00:00–00:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Gradio, Python, Debugging, Metadata, Semantic Search  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance and debug the Semantic Search UI using Gradio and ensure proper metadata handling in [[Python]] applications.

### Key Activities
- Implemented the `get_all_tags()` function to retrieve unique, sorted tags from ChromaDB, improving the Semantic Search UI.
- Fixed parameter name mismatches in Gradio's [[API]] and resolved a `TypeError` in the `TabbedInterface`.
- Corrected initialization issues in Gradio's `TabbedInterface` and troubleshooted search button functionality.
- Debugged the `search_handler()` function to handle empty query strings effectively.
- Enhanced the `memory.py` setup to align with working notebook logic, focusing on embedding function setup.
- Cleaned up metadata fields stored as stringified lists and validated [[JSON]] structure to ensure data integrity.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and debugged key functionalities in the Gradio UI, improving the overall user experience.
- Ensured metadata fields are correctly formatted and validated, enhancing data integrity.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the Gradio UI to ensure all functionalities work seamlessly.
- Continuous validation of metadata fields for any new data ingested.
