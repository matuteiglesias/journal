**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to optimize feedback loop mechanisms and improve annotation fidelity within [[AI]] systems.

### Key Activities
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset with 2,037 annotated responses to evaluate field consistency and potential schema enforcement.
- Analyzed overuse of the 'insight' category in annotations, proposing targeted improvements for better classification accuracy.
- Developed a structured definition for the `note_type` field to enhance note organization and retrieval.
- Addressed taxonomy drift in category fields, recommending strategic category collapses for improved data organization.
- Refined message type classification to better capture communicative intent and improve data categorization.
- Proposed a refined definition of 'actionable' in task management to prioritize explicit action items.

### Achievements
- Clarified the need for schema enforcement in feedback loop datasets.
- Identified key improvements for annotation strategies to enhance usability.
- Established a semi-hierarchical taxonomy for note types.
- Provided strategic recommendations for managing taxonomy drift and improving message classification.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed schema enforcement for feedback loop datasets.
- Develop a detailed plan for the refined annotation strategy.
- Execute the taxonomy adjustments and message classification refinements.
