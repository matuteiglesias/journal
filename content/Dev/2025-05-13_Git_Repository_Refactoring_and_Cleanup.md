### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to refactor the project directory structure, update version control settings, and clean up the Git history to improve code organization and security.

### Key Activities
- Proposed a reorganization of the `services` directory, suggesting which files to keep, move, or delete.
- Updated the `.gitignore` file to align with the new project structure, ensuring essential configurations are retained.
- Outlined best practices for making semantic commits post-refactoring.
- Developed a commit [[strategy]] for thematic organization of significant project changes.
- Provided detailed instructions for resolving Git merge and rebase conflicts, including specific file conflicts like `evaluator.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- Executed a Git rebase to align local and remote branches, resolving all conflicts.
- Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive files from Git history and ensured the repository was clean and secure.

### Achievements
- Successfully reorganized the project directory and updated the `.gitignore`.
- Resolved all Git conflicts and completed a rebase, ensuring the repository is up-to-date.
- Cleaned the Git history of sensitive files, enhancing security.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the repository for any further issues related to file structure or version control.
- Continue to apply best practices for commit messages and Git operations.
