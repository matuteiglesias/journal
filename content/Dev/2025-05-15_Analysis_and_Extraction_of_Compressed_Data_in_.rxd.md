## 📅 2025-05-15 — Session: Analysis and Extraction of Compressed Data in .rxdb Files

**🕒 00:05–00:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Extraction, Compression, Rxdb, LZ4, Zlib  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and extract embedded dictionaries and compressed data blocks from `.rxdb` files without recompiling C++ code.

### Key Activities
- Explored methods to test hypotheses and extract embedded dictionaries using shell commands and [[Python]] scripts.
- Analyzed the structure of `.rxdb` files to determine if they were compressed or encrypted, using entropy and statistical tests.
- Diagnosed specific blocks within `.rxdb` files for compression issues, focusing on zlib and gzip headers.
- Employed tools like `binwalk`, `grep`, `dd`, `file`, and custom scripts to extract and analyze compressed data blocks.
- Identified LZ4 magic signatures in `.rxdb` files and outlined steps for extraction and decompression.

### Achievements
- Developed strategies for diagnosing and extracting compressed data blocks using various tools and scripts.
- Identified potential compression formats and provided troubleshooting steps for LZ4 decoding errors.

### Pending Tasks
- Further investigation into alternative compression formats and manual offset reading for data extraction.
- Implementation of a C++ script for reading strings from specific offsets if required.
