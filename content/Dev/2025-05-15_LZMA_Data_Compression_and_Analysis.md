## üìÖ 2025-05-15 ‚Äî Session: LZMA Data Compression and Analysis

**üïí 00:35‚Äì00:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: LZMA, Compression, Data Analysis, Python, Decompression  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and process LZMA compressed data streams, focusing on extraction, testing, and decoding techniques.

### Key Activities
1. **Histogram Analysis**: A histogram was created to illustrate the distribution of distances in compressed data, aiding pattern detection.
2. **LZMA Block Extraction**: Detailed the process to identify and extract LZMA blocks from raw data using specific bash commands.
3. **Testing [[Strategy]]**: Developed a strategy to test the hypothesis regarding the LZMA block signature `\x5d\x00\x00\x80`.
4. **Partial Decoding Insights**: Achieved partial success in decoding LZMA streams, suggesting further extraction methods.
5. **Decoding Analysis**: Documented observations on block decoding, highlighting issues and proposing solutions.
6. **[[Python]] Decompression Script**: Implemented a [[Python]] script to attempt decompression using various parameters.

### Achievements
- Successfully created visual aids for pattern detection in compressed data.
- Established a workflow for extracting and testing LZMA blocks.
- Developed a [[Python]] script for flexible decompression attempts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine extraction methods based on partial decoding insights.
- Continue testing with additional configurations to improve decompression success.
