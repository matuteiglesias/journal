## 📅 2025-05-17 — Session: Developed Modular Clustering Script

**🕒 21:30–22:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Clustering, Data Processing, Modularization, Chromadb, Notebooks  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The aim of this session was to develop and organize a modular structure for clustering scripts and data processing pipelines.

### Key Activities
- Identified potential sources for clustering scripts and related information.
- Developed Bash and Unix commands to locate and manage [[Jupyter]] notebooks.
- Proposed and outlined a modular structure for data processing and clustering using ChromaDB.
- Created a notebook for data extraction and preprocessing, connecting to ChromaDB and exporting data to [[CSV]].
- Discussed efficient file formats for saving embeddings.
- Provided [[Python]] code for listing collection names in Chroma.
- Organized notebooks for feature engineering and clustering with HDBSCAN and UMAP.

### Achievements
- Established a clear modular structure for data processing and clustering.
- Implemented data extraction and preprocessing workflows.
- Enhanced understanding of efficient data storage formats.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement and testing of the proposed modular structure.
- Implementation of the full clustering pipeline using the outlined notebooks.
