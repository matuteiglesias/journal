### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance clustering techniques using UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN for clustering, with a focus on parameter tuning and visualization.

### Key Activities
- Adjusted parameters for HDBSCAN to optimize cluster numbers, focusing on `min_cluster_size`, `min_samples`, and `cluster_selection_epsilon`.
- Explored latent structures using UMAP with projections in more than two dimensions to gain additional insights.
- Implemented [[Python]] code to visualize UMAP projections and evaluate clustering quality using silhouette scores.
- Resolved size conflicts in UMAP visualizations by adjusting slicing strategies.
- Developed a loop for iterating through UMAP projection axes to enhance [[data visualization]].
- Created a customizable HDBSCAN clustering function with parameter exploration capabilities.
- Designed an exploratory loop to analyze clustering results, including noise clusters.
- Proposed a hyperparameter explorer for HDBSCAN to optimize cluster numbers and minimize noise.

### Achievements
- Successfully optimized HDBSCAN parameters for better clustering results.
- Enhanced [[data visualization]] through improved UMAP projections.
- Developed tools for systematic exploration of clustering configurations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the hyperparameter explorer for HDBSCAN.
- [[Integration]] of clustering results into broader [[data analysis]] workflows.
