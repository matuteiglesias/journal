**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: LLM, Debugging, Openai, Function_Call, Python  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to debug and enhance the function calling capabilities within the OpenAI [[API]], focusing on improving reliability and error handling.

### Key Activities
- Debugged issues with LLM's function calling logic, ensuring correct triggering and error handling.
- Addressed common problems in OpenAI [[API]] function calls, focusing on prompt formatting and execution clarity.
- Enhanced [[Python]] logging for robust debugging of [[API]] calls, including detailed input/output logging.
- Analyzed and improved the `parsed_message` function, addressing issues with long prompts.
- Reflected on structural and semantic differences in prompt engineering, and identified challenges in schema completion by LLMs.
- Diagnosed issues in LLM processing, suggesting improvements in prompt tokens and logging practices.
- Provided comprehensive [[Python]] code for enhanced observability in LLM call debugging.

### Achievements
- Improved debugging techniques for OpenAI function calls.
- Developed enhanced logging and error handling strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement suggested improvements in prompt engineering and logging practices.
- Further testing of the enhanced debugging strategies in different scenarios.
