**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to automate the generation and testing of daily JSONL files from session data, and to enhance session summarization processes for [[AI]] models.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] script to organize session data into daily JSONL files, ensuring each line represents a session with preserved structure and metadata.
- Tested the generated JSONL files in PromptFlow, following a detailed command structure and sanity checklist.
- Corrected YAML syntax for PromptFlow, focusing on the classic YAML mapping style.
- Outlined guidelines for summarizing [[AI]] session logs, emphasizing strategic reflection and outcome articulation.
- Provided a comprehensive Jinja2 template for session summarization, focusing on cognitive compression and structured reflection.
- Detailed a [[JSON]] Schema to capture structured outputs from a session summarizer.
- Structured a [[JSON]] request for the task management [[API]], ensuring session-derived content is incorporated.
- Resolved a schema name mismatch error in PromptFlow by identifying the root cause and implementing a fix.
- Built a flow for transforming structured session logs into actionable outputs, ensuring schema compliance and traceability.

### Achievements
- Successfully automated the generation and testing of JSONL files.
- Enhanced the session summarization process with new templates and guidelines.
- Improved schema management and error resolution processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the JSONL file generation script in diverse environments.
- Continuous improvement of session summarization templates based on feedback.
