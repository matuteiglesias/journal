## üìÖ 2025-05-18 ‚Äî Session: FlowPower Development and Optimization

**üïí 01:20‚Äì02:05**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: FlowPower, PromptFlow, system optimization, CLI, integration  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed at advancing the development and [[optimization]] of the FlowPower system, focusing on various components such as system [[optimization]], orchestration, and integration.

### Key Activities
- **Linux System Optimization**: Diagnosed and proposed optimizations for a Linux system.
- **[[PromptFlow]] Analysis**: Developed a modular orchestration system for [[AI]] flows using [[PromptFlow]].
- **Technical Sprint Closure**: Concluded a technical sprint and planned strategically for FlowPower and [[PromptFlow]].
- **FlowPower Executor Development**: Designed, implemented, and refactored the `executor.py` module for better maintainability.
- **Observability Layer Implementation**: Implemented I/O and traceability layers for improved diagnostics.
- **YAML Schema Analysis**: Analyzed YAML headers and designed introspective tools.
- **Prompty Class [[Integration]]**: Integrated the `Prompty` class into the FlowPower execution engine.
- **CLI [[Debugging]] and Refactoring**: Enhanced the FlowPower CLI using the Typer library.

### Achievements
- Improved system diagnostics and [[debugging]] capabilities.
- Enhanced the maintainability and testability of the FlowPower system.
- Successful integration of new classes and modules.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of [[AI]] identity and agency.
- Continued development of introspective tools for YAML analysis.
- Ongoing improvements to the FlowPower CLI.
