### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to address and resolve issues related to misalignment and incorrect referencing in YAML configurations used in PromptFlow and software development environments.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing Output Misalignment**: Addressed inconsistencies in the output definitions within a PromptFlow YAML configuration.
- **Correcting Output Structure**: Ensured the `summary` field in `flow.dag.yaml` was correctly referenced from `llm_node.result`.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Output Aliasing**: Analyzed and provided solutions for output aliasing issues in YAML configurations.
- **Comparative Diagnosis**: Conducted a detailed analysis of working and non-working configurations in `flow.dag.yaml`.
- **Revised Jinja2 Prompt**: Developed a structured Jinja2 prompt for summarizing GPT activity logs.
- **[[Debugging]] LLM Call**: Debugged LLM call and schema validation issues.
- **[[Debugging]] Print Output**: Provided solutions for handling `print()` statement issues in PromptFlow.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the misalignment and aliasing issues in YAML configurations.
