**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to troubleshoot and resolve various issues related to PromptFlow schema updates and [[Python]] [[API]] function calls.

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] PromptFlow Schema Updates**: Addressed issues with PromptFlow not reflecting schema and prompt updates by validating, clearing caches, ensuring schema consistency, updating component scripts, and restarting the flow.
- **Diagnosis and Fix for PromptFlow Function Call Issue**: Diagnosed and fixed a problem where the PromptFlow function call was not triggered properly, involving adjustments to the flow definition and schema loading.
- **Fixing Extraction Issue in [[Python]] LLM Wrapper**: Modified code to correctly extract tool call arguments from OpenAI [[API]] responses, fixing errors related to missing attributes.
- **Implementation of Robust Handler for Function Calls**: Developed a handler to support both legacy and modern function call responses in [[Python]], ensuring backward compatibility and error handling.
- **Diagnosing LLM Output Issues with New Schema Fields**: Analyzed and fixed an LLM output problem where new schema fields were missing, by explicitly prompting for these fields in the template.
- **[[Debugging]] Schema Mismatch in OpenAI Function Calls**: Troubleshot OpenAI function calling issues related to schema mismatches, providing strategies for verifying schema integrity.

### Achievements
Successfully resolved multiple issues across PromptFlow and [[Python]] [[API]] integrations, improving the reliability of schema updates and function calls.

### Pending Tasks
No pending tasks were identified; all issues addressed during the session were resolved.
