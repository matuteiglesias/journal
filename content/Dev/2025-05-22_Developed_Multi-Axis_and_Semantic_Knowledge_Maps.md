## 📅 2025-05-22 — Session: Developed Multi-Axis and Semantic Knowledge Maps

**🕒 02:45–04:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Knowledge Mapping, Semantic Map, Ai Architecture, Cerebrum Sdk, Content Strategy  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop structured approaches for knowledge mapping, focusing on both multi-axis and semantic dimensions.

### Key Activities
- Built a multi-axis knowledge map framework to enhance personal knowledge management.
- Created a project plan for a semantic knowledge map, including theme normalization and tagging schema design.
- Analyzed academic logs for strategic engagement and publication potential.
- Outlined strategic self-positioning for [[AI]]-native systems, emphasizing modular automation.
- Proposed a playbook for an LLM-powered app factory and [[AI]] agent architecture.
- Compiled insights on [[AI]] architecture principles and developer ergonomics.
- Strategized content positioning for the Cerebrum SDK and reassessed its documentation value.

### Achievements
- Established foundational frameworks for knowledge and semantic mapping.
- Developed strategic content plans for [[AI]]-native systems and SDK documentation.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed tagging schema and classification methods for the semantic map.
- Execute the content plans for [[AI]]-native systems and Cerebrum SDK documentation.
