## 📅 2025-05-22 — Session: Enhanced Dendrogram Visualization and Docusaurus Structuring

**🕒 06:25–07:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: dendrogram, visualization, Docusaurus, clustering, knowledge management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance dendrogram visualizations and structure content in a [[Docusaurus]] wiki for better knowledge management and user interaction.

### Key Activities
- Improved dendrogram visualization by refining cluster separation, tick label readability, and layout.
- Refined TF-IDF vectorization code for better clustering clarity.
- Advocated using Chroma embeddings for semantic clustering over TF-IDF.
- Developed [[Python]] code for hierarchical clustering with visualization improvements.
- Extracted sorted IDs from hierarchical clustering using [[Python]]'s `scipy`.
- Analyzed dendrogram drift to formalize cluster boundaries and enhance knowledge organization.
- Designed a [[Docusaurus]] section architecture focusing on user intent and content function.
- Provided user intent examples for LLM tools and [[automation]] in the [[Docusaurus]] context.
- Visualized the [[Docusaurus]] wiki structure and proposed sectional plans for content organization.
- Mapped dendrogram entries and summaries to the [[Docusaurus]] wiki structure.

### Achievements
- Successfully improved dendrogram visualizations and provided a structured plan for organizing [[Docusaurus]] content.
- Created a comprehensive framework for integrating dendrogram insights into the [[Docusaurus]] wiki.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed [[Docusaurus]] section architecture and integrate the mapped dendrogram entries into the wiki.
