**🕒 17:30–18:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Docusaurus, MDX, Webpack, Error Fix, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and resolve various errors encountered during the build and static site generation processes using [[Docusaurus]] and MDX.

### Key Activities
- **Fixing [[Docusaurus]] CLI Not Found Error**: Reinstalled dependencies and ran a clean build to resolve the error.
- **Addressed Webpack Warning**: Investigated non-serializable data structures in Webpack's caching system, specifically `VFileMessage` objects, and outlined potential solutions.
- **Debugged MDX Compilation Errors**: Identified and fixed common MDX compilation errors related to malformed frontmatter and illegal syntax.
- **Resolved MDX Runtime Exception**: Fixed a runtime exception in MDX pages caused by an undefined variable 'platform' during static site generation.
- **Escaped Curly Braces in MDX**: Implemented a method to prevent MDX parser from interpreting curly braces as [[JavaScript]].

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved the [[Docusaurus]] CLI error and MDX runtime exceptions.
- Improved understanding of Webpack caching issues and MDX syntax handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further investigation into Webpack caching strategies may be needed.
- Review and optimize the MDX [[debugging]] process for future occurrences.
