- Addressed a logic issue in code for handling duplicate entries in document collections, suggesting the use of a dictionary for optimization.
- Created a unified [[Python]] function, `clean_spider_text`, to clean web-scraped markdown content by removing images, links, and standalone URLs.
- Outlined a structured list of academic publications from ICC, including metadata fields and thematic insights.
- Detailed the structure and content of a news aggregation page for ICC, suggesting methods for data extraction and analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented functions for cleaning and processing web-scraped content.
- Provided insights and structured analyses for institutional web pages.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the data extraction methods for the ICC news aggregation page.
- Implement the recommended post-processing steps for ICC content normalization.
