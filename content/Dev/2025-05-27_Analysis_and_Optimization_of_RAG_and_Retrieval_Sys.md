## üìÖ 2025-05-27 ‚Äî Session: Analysis and Optimization of RAG and Retrieval Systems

**üïí 03:30‚Äì04:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: RAG, retrieval, automation, query optimization, deployment, onboarding  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and optimize the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and retrieval systems for contact management and other [[automation]] tasks.

### Key Activities
- **RAG Pipeline Failure Analysis**: Identified issues in the RAG pipeline related to automated workflows for contact management, focusing on answer generation, retrieval quality, and prompt structure.
- **Query Crafting Strategies**: Developed strategies for crafting retriever-friendly queries and longer paragraphs to improve retrieval performance, especially for systems with suboptimal retrievers like BM25.
- **Successful Retrieval Phase Analysis**: Analyzed a successful retrieval phase, highlighting strong lexical overlap and temporal grounding, and suggested improvements for query [[optimization]].
- **[[Automation]] and [[Integration]]**: Reviewed the current state of contact management [[automation]], including data import, reminder [[automation]], and integration with tools like HubSpot and [[Python]] scripts.
- **RAG-Driven Recovery Plan**: Outlined a systematic approach for recovering unfinished projects using RAG systems.
- **[[Deployment]] and Technical Documentation**: Created checklists for deploying Hugo with [[GitHub]] Pages and Notebooks, and developed a cheatsheet for [[PromptFlow]] and FlowPower.

### Achievements
- Identified key problems and areas for improvement in the RAG pipeline and retrieval systems.
- Developed actionable strategies for enhancing query crafting and retrieval performance.
- Created comprehensive checklists and technical [[documentation]] to support deployment and onboarding processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed improvements in the RAG pipeline and retrieval systems.
- Finalize and execute the RAG-driven recovery plan.
- Complete the deployment of Hugo with [[GitHub]] Pages and Notebooks based on the checklists.
