### Session Goal
The session aimed to diagnose and correct configuration issues related to MySQL and OAuth setups, ensuring smooth backend connections and OAuth operations.

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed a critical inconsistency in MySQL configuration that was preventing backend connections and provided corrective actions.
- Configured port bindings for a MySQL Docker container, ensuring it was linked to port 5455 instead of the default 3306.
- Analyzed MySQL configuration, focusing on OAuth settings and LLM factory definitions.
- Set up and validated local OAuth configuration for Google login, including creating credentials in the [[Google Cloud]] Console.
- Diagnosed and debugged issues related to YAML configuration for OAuth, ensuring the 'oauth' block was correctly loaded into the `CONFIGS` dictionary.
- Addressed a configuration initialization issue in a deployed app, ensuring the `CONFIGS` variable was correctly loaded during app startup.
- Conducted server diagnostics to identify closed ports causing failed HTTP requests.

### Achievements
- Successfully corrected MySQL configuration issues and ensured proper Docker container port settings.
- Established a valid local OAuth setup for Google login.
- Resolved YAML configuration loading issues, ensuring correct parsing and inclusion of necessary blocks.
- Identified and suggested solutions for server port issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further monitoring of server diagnostics to ensure no recurring port issues.
- Continuous validation of OAuth configurations in different environments.
