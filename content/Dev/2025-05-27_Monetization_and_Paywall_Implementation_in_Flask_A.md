### Session Goal
The session aimed to implement monetization controls and paywall mechanisms within a [[Flask]]-based application, focusing on backend and frontend integration.

### Key Activities
- Developed a monetization control strategy for DocumentService, focusing on high-cost actions and paywall enforcement.
- Implemented paywall enforcement in token management, including quota management and error handling.
- Refactored code for monetization design, emphasizing user-specific tracking and token quota enforcement.
- Patched PlanManager for cost management in MindMapExtractor and embedding processes.
- Analyzed project's functional architecture to identify monetization logic points.
- Outlined and implemented a paywall system for both backend and frontend using [[Flask]].
- Developed a checklist and implementation plan for UI-layer paywall, including authentication and routing.
- Created and tested `/api/user/me` endpoint for user management and authentication.
- Reviewed frontend patch for compatibility with backend, focusing on user state management.
- Provided local testing guide for UI-level paywall and setup instructions for `ragflow` application.
- Resolved `ruamel` installation issues and provided [[Python]] environment setup instructions.
- Diagnosed and fixed [[Flask]] application issues, focusing on server launch and dependency installation.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a monetization strategy and paywall system in the [[Flask]] application.
- Enhanced the authentication system to support user subscription plans.
- Improved codebase for better user-specific tracking and quota management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the paywall system in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization of the monetization controls.
