**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to address and resolve configuration issues related to a [[Flask]] application and Elasticsearch setup.

### Key Activities
- **[[Flask]] OAUTH Configuration Issue**: Diagnosed and provided solutions for the `settings.OAUTH_CONFIG` being `None`, including likely causes and workarounds.
- **Elasticsearch Connection Problems**: Tackled connection issues with Elasticsearch, offering solutions for local setup and addressing design flaws causing unnecessary coupling.
- **Docker and Elasticsearch Setup**: Configured and verified Elasticsearch within a Docker container, including authentication and configuration adjustments.
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Elasticsearch Startup**: Outlined steps for troubleshooting Elasticsearch startup issues, focusing on logs, memory, and security settings.
- **[[Python]] Configuration Error**: Resolved an `AttributeError` in [[Python]] caused by YAML misconfiguration, implementing a defensive coding check.

### Achievements
- Successfully diagnosed and provided actionable solutions for both [[Flask]] and Elasticsearch configuration issues.
- Improved the robustness of the Elasticsearch setup within Docker.
- Enhanced [[error handling]] in [[Python]] configuration files.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the [[Flask]] application with the new OAUTH configuration.
- Continuous monitoring of Elasticsearch performance post-configuration adjustments.
