## 📅 2025-05-28 — Session: Automated Micro-Narratives and Git Branch Sync

**🕒 08:00–08:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Automation, Git, Macroeconomics, Documentation, News Aggregator  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to automate the creation of micro-narratives from Argentine macroeconomic data and to manage [[Git]] branches effectively.

### Key Activities
- Developed a structured approach for automating micro-narratives using Argentine macroeconomic datasets.
- Outlined a safe method to move changes from the `gh-pages` branch to the `main` branch in [[Git]], ensuring deployment content remains untouched.
- Provided instructions for syncing `gh-pages` with `main`, including options for maintaining or overwriting history.
- Created a Spanish README template for the `economia.gob.ar-datos` repository, detailing its purpose and structure.
- Drafted a README for the `economia.gob.ar` repository, outlining the automated pipeline for processing public data.
- Formulated clarification questions for tailoring a report, focusing on programming languages, deployment, and other requirements.
- Prepared a report on building a backend-focused news aggregator for economic news in Argentina, detailing technical strategies and data pipeline considerations.

### Achievements
- Established a framework for automating narrative generation from macroeconomic data.
- Successfully managed [[Git]] branch synchronization between `gh-pages` and `main`.
- Enhanced documentation for public data repositories.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the backend-focused news aggregator report.
- Implement the automation strategy for micro-narratives.

### Status
Completed
