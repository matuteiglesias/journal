### Session Goal
The aim of this session was to enhance debugging capabilities for the Twitter [[API]] client and resolve OAuth-related errors, particularly the 403 Forbidden error.

### Key Activities
- Enhanced the `request` method of the Twitter client to include detailed debug prints and error handling for various HTTP status codes.
- Investigated and resolved a 403 error caused by incorrect OAuth permissions, providing a step-by-step guide to adjust settings in the Twitter Developer Portal.
- Debugged OAuth 1.0a permissions, focusing on app permissions and token regeneration.
- Configured local OAuth testing for a Twitter application, detailing app type selection and callback URI requirements.

### Achievements
- Successfully patched the Twitter client for better debugging and error handling.
- Resolved OAuth permission issues, ensuring proper configuration for creating tweets.
- Set up a local testing environment for OAuth, facilitating further development and testing.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the OAuth configuration in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of [[API]] requests based on debug outputs.
