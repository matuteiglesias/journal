## üìÖ 2025-05-28 ‚Äî Session: Refactored Data Processing and Export Scripts

**üïí 07:15‚Äì07:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: CI/CD, Data Pipeline, Python, Export Csv, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to enhance and troubleshoot various components of data processing and export scripts.

### Key Activities
- **Local Testing for CI/CD [[Pipeline]]**: Conducted local testing of a data processing pipeline to ensure deterministic behavior before deployment in GitHub CI/CD.
- **Disk Usage Analysis**: Utilized Bash commands to analyze disk usage for effective resource management.
- **Script Modification**: Proposed and partially implemented modifications to a [[Python]] download script, incorporating logic to exclude certain file types and sizes.
- **Onboarding Guide Creation**: Developed an onboarding guide for a public data ingestion pipeline, focusing on automation and reproducibility.
- **[[CSV]] Export Script Overview**: Reviewed and documented the `export_csv.py` script, which facilitates data extraction from SQLite to [[CSV]].
- **Error Diagnosis**: Diagnosed a synchronization error in the [[CSV]] export script due to missing database columns and proposed a dynamic extraction approach.

### Achievements
- Successfully tested the local CI/CD pipeline setup.
- Improved understanding of disk usage management.
- Enhanced the download script with file exclusion logic.
- Created a comprehensive onboarding guide for data ingestion.

### Pending Tasks
- Complete the implementation of the file exclusion logic in the download script.
- Resolve the synchronization error in the [[CSV]] export script by updating the database schema or script logic.
