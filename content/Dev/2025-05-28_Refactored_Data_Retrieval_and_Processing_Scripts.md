### Session Goal
The main goal of this session was to enhance the data retrieval and processing workflows by updating scripts and proposing modular architectures.

### Key Activities
- Updated a script for data retrieval to access a new domain and structure, eliminating the need for [[HTML]] scraping. This involved verifying URLs and organizing downloadable files into categories.
- Proposed a modular architecture for a linear exploratory notebook to improve reusability, reproducibility, and maintainability.
- Developed scripts for automation, focusing on downloading files, extracting ZIPs, and exporting data from SQLite to [[CSV]].
- Evaluated the `download.py` script for adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle, enhancing modularity.
- Compared zip extraction scripts to highlight improvements in modularity and batch processing capabilities.
- Reviewed and validated scripts for exporting SQLite data to [[CSV]], ensuring functionality replication and suggesting improvements.
- Detailed an automated pipeline for maintaining a local copy of a time series dataset using GitHub Actions.

### Achievements
- Successfully updated and evaluated multiple scripts, ensuring they adhere to best practices in modularity and clarity.
- Proposed effective strategies for refactoring and automating data processing workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed modular architecture for the exploratory notebook.
- Further refine and test the automated pipeline for time series datasets.

### Outcome
The session resulted in a comprehensive set of updated and new scripts that enhance the efficiency and maintainability of data retrieval and processing tasks.
