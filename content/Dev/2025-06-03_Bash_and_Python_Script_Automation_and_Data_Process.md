**üïí 22:30‚Äì23:55**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Bash, Python, Automation, Data Processing, Pandas, SQL  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the automation of [[Python]] script execution using Bash and to conduct a comprehensive analysis of data processing techniques and pipelines.

### Key Activities
- Developed a Bash script to recursively execute [[Python]] scripts, track execution time, and handle errors gracefully.
- Analyzed errors in [[Python]] scripts and provided debugging recommendations.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of data processing techniques using pandas and duckdb.
- Evaluated data science projects, focusing on data cleaning, SQL queries, and pipeline modularity.
- Proposed improvements for data cleaning pipelines and SQL optimization.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a Bash script for batch testing and error tracking of [[Python]] scripts.
- Identified key areas for improvement in data processing pipelines and SQL queries.
- Provided actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing data workflows.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed improvements in data cleaning pipelines and SQL optimization.
- Continue monitoring and refining the automation scripts for better performance.
