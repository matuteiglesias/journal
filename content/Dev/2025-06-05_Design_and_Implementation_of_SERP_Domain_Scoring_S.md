### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design and implement a scoring system for Search Engine Results Page (SERP) domains, focusing on their relevance to employer Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) or direct application pages.

### Key Activities
- **Designing a Scoring System:** Developed a structured approach for ranking SERP domains, including heuristics for scoring and integration with a DataFrame.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Assessed potential edge cases and suggested improvements to enhance the scoring system's robustness and accuracy.
- **Domain Categorization:** Established a framework for categorizing domains related to ATS, job boards, and employer sites.
- **Implementation:** Created a [[Python]] function for labeling domains using dictionaries and applied these labels to a DataFrame.
- **Unknown Domains Categorization:** Analyzed and categorized unknown domains into existing labels and provided recommendations for integration.
- **Ranking Job Aggregators:** Ranked job aggregators by effectiveness and proposed labels and scores.
- **Refinement:** Refined the labeling and scoring function for domains to ensure consistent categorization.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive scoring system for SERP domains.
- Enhanced the categorization framework for ATS and job boards.
- Improved the labeling and scoring functions for better data integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further review and testing of the scoring system to handle additional edge cases.
- Continuous refinement of domain categorization strategies.
