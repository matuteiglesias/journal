### Session Goal
The session aimed to critically analyze and improve financial data processing functions to enhance code robustness and efficiency.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a critical analysis of `get_from_ledger` and `compute_transaction_series` functions, identifying strengths and weaknesses.
- Evaluated various financial calculation functions, providing recommendations for improving their robustness and clarity.
- Reviewed functions for financial data processing, highlighting strengths, observations, and improvement suggestions.
- Proposed a comprehensive diagnostic and functional mapping of a continuous financial monitoring system using Google Sheets.
- Analyzed projection functions `get_obs_period` and `calculate_future_value`, offering technical recommendations for their implementation.

### Achievements
- Identified key areas for improvement in financial data processing functions.
- Developed a framework for a financial monitoring system.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the recommended improvements in the analyzed functions.
- Develop and test the proposed financial monitoring system framework.
