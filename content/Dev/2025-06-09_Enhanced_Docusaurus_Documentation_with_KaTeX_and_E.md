## 📅 2025-06-09 — Session: Enhanced Docusaurus Documentation with KaTeX and Error Handling

**🕒 21:35–22:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Docusaurus, KaTeX, Markdown, Error Handling, Integration, Troubleshooting  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to improve [[documentation]] practices in [[Docusaurus]] by integrating KaTeX for math rendering and addressing common errors.

### Key Activities
- Enhanced prompt design for better readability and engagement using Markdown and LaTeX.
- Implemented cross-referencing techniques in [[Docusaurus]], similar to LaTeX.
- Fixed MDX parsing errors related to LaTeX in [[Docusaurus]].
- Integrated KaTeX with [[Docusaurus]] for math rendering, using `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.
- Diagnosed and resolved KaTeX rendering issues in Markdown.
- Conducted a battle test for math equation rendering in [[Docusaurus]].
- Resolved rendering issues of KaTeX in [[Docusaurus]].
- Troubleshot ChunkLoadError in [[Docusaurus]] and JSONL file loading error in [[Python]].

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated KaTeX into [[Docusaurus]], improving the rendering of math equations.
- Resolved various parsing and rendering issues, enhancing the [[documentation]]'s robustness.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of KaTeX integration in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring for any new errors in [[Docusaurus]] [[documentation]].
