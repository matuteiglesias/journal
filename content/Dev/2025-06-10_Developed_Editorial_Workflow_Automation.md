### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and implement a structured editorial workflow pipeline for processing articles from raw input to publication, leveraging automation tools and [[AI]]-driven solutions.

### Key Activities
- **Structured Editorial [[Workflow]] Pipeline**: Outlined a framework for processing articles, detailing each stage's inputs, processes, and outputs.
- **Systematic Prompt Definitions**: Developed prompt definitions for various article processing stages, including [[CSV]] parsing and agenda generation.
- **Function Calling in OpenAI [[API]]**: Explored function calling for structured data handling in OpenAI [[API]].
- **Fuzzy Row Selection in Azure ML**: Implemented a fuzzy row selection mechanism using OpenAI's function calling within Azure ML.
- **Handling Function Calling Limitations**: Addressed limitations and strategies for function calling in LLMs.
- **Function Schema for Article Parsing**: Designed a robust schema for parsing and clustering news articles.
- **Jinja Prompts for Article Processing**: Developed multiple Jinja prompts for tasks like seed card generation, draft article creation, and metadata annotation.
- **Pipeline Design for LLM Screening**: Outlined a minimal starter pipeline for LLM screening.
- **AzureML PromptFlow Pipeline Design**: Streamlined a pipeline for parsing and clustering articles in AzureML.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive editorial workflow with automation and [[AI]] components.
- Developed templates and schemas to enhance data processing and article generation.
- Enhanced AzureML pipelines with improved data parsing and mapping techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the designed pipelines and test their integration with existing systems.
- Further refine prompt definitions and schemas based on testing outcomes.
