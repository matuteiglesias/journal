## üìÖ 2025-06-11 ‚Äî Session: AI Output Evaluation and Prompt Refinement

**üïí 05:15‚Äì06:33**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: AI evaluation, prompt refinement, data processing, article clustering  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to evaluate [[AI]]-generated outputs for clustering news articles and refine prompts for better [[data processing]] and analysis.

### Key Activities
1. **Markdown File Metadata Parser**: Implemented a [[Python]] script to parse markdown filenames into structured metadata and save as [[JSON]] lines.
2. **[[Data Processing]] Pipeline**: Developed a pipeline using JSONL input with AzureML Flow schema and Jinja prompts for clustering news articles.
3. **[[AI]] Output Evaluation**: Conducted a critical analysis of [[AI]]-generated outputs related to article clustering on US tariffs, focusing on strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Prompt Refinement**: Improved prompts for analyzing [[CSV]] news articles and processing news headlines, emphasizing clustering and deduplication.
5. **Content Strategy and Analysis**: Generated seed ideas for articles and analyzed the automotive sector's growth in Argentina.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented a metadata parser and [[data processing]] pipeline.
- Conducted thorough evaluations of [[AI]] outputs, identifying key areas for improvement.
- Refined prompts to enhance clarity and consistency in [[data processing]] tasks.

### Pending Tasks
- Further improvements in clustering logic and editorial review processes.
- Continued evaluation of [[AI]] outputs to enhance topic relevance and source ID accuracy.

### Conclusion
The session successfully addressed the evaluation of [[AI]] outputs and the refinement of prompts, laying the groundwork for improved [[data processing]] and content analysis workflows.
