## 📅 2025-06-11 — Session: Data Pipeline and Scraping Enhancements

**🕒 15:40–18:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data pipeline, web scraping, Python, SOAP notes, error handling  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the [[data processing]] and scraping pipelines by analyzing current implementations, proposing new designs, and addressing code issues.

### Key Activities
- **SOAP Notes Templates**: Created structured SOAP notes for various medical procedures, including hernioplasty, tubal ligation, perineoplasty, and curettage, to ensure comprehensive patient [[documentation]].
- **Pipeline Analysis**: Conducted a detailed analysis of the [[data processing]] pipeline, identifying strengths and areas for improvement, particularly in [[error handling]] and scalability.
- **Design Proposal**: Proposed a new architecture for an RSS article fetching pipeline, focusing on separation of concerns and implementation details.
- **[[Python]] Scripting**: Developed and refined [[Python]] scripts for managing master article indexes, including deduplication and incremental updates.
- **[[Error Handling]]**: Addressed KeyError issues in DataFrame processing and argparse handling in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Scraping Enhancements**: Implemented improvements in scraping scripts, including temporal filtering and backlog management.

### Achievements
- Developed robust SOAP note templates for various surgical procedures.
- Proposed and designed enhancements for [[data processing]] and scraping pipelines.
- Improved [[error handling]] in [[Python]] scripts to prevent crashes and ensure data integrity.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and deployment of the proposed RSS article fetching pipeline.
- Continuous monitoring and [[optimization]] of scraping processes to handle backlog efficiently.
