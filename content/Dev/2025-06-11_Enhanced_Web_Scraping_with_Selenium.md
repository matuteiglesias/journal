## 📅 2025-06-11 — Session: Enhanced Web Scraping with Selenium

**🕒 08:20–09:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Selenium, Web Scraping, Python, Error Handling, Automation  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance web scraping capabilities using Selenium, focusing on robust [[error handling]], timeout management, and process isolation.

### Key Activities
- **Fetched Content from Google News:** Explored methods for fetching content using HTML scraping, RSS feed parsing, and discussed [[API]] limitations.
- **[[Data Processing]] with [[Pandas]]:** Developed a [[Python]] script for loading, concatenating, and deduplicating [[CSV]] files.
- **Crawler Implementation:** Structured a web crawler in Jupyter Notebook, emphasizing [[error handling]] and scalability.
- **Selenium-Based [[Web Scraping]]:** Analyzed and improved various Selenium scripts for web scraping, including:
  - Implementing a minimal Selenium script for URL page source extraction.
  - Updating scripts for better timeout handling and error management.
  - Ensuring thread safety by creating separate WebDriver instances.
  - Managing ChromeDriver processes effectively.
  - Declaring options and driver in web scraping code for efficiency.

### Achievements
- Developed a refined Selenium-based web scraping script with improved [[error handling]] and timeout management.
- Ensured robust thread safety and process isolation in web scraping tasks.
- Implemented best practices for Selenium driver management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the enhanced Selenium scripts in different environments to ensure robustness.
- Exploration of additional web scraping tools and techniques for scalability and efficiency.
