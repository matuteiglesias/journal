- Solved JSONL structure issues in [[Pandas]] and provided a code example.
- Discussed [[optimization]] of [[AI]] data pipelines and future refinement considerations.
- Diagnosed [[JSON]] errors in model outputs and provided solutions.

### Achievements
- Enhanced [[JSON]] and editorial schemas for better data handling and [[strategic planning]].
- Provided actionable solutions for JSONL issues in [[data processing]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further [[optimization]] of [[AI]] data pipelines based on discussed considerations.
