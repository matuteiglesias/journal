## 📅 2025-06-12 — Session: Enhanced Digest Processing and Automation

**🕒 00:15–01:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Automation, Daemon, Scripting, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the `03_headlines_digests.py` script and its associated automation processes.

### Key Activities
- Enhanced the `03_headlines_digests.py` script to be digest-aware and idempotent, ensuring it processes only new files with optional force reprocessing.
- Fixed digest ID logic for [[CSV]] matching using regex for precision.
- Resolved directory mismatch issues in [[CSV]] file processing.
- Improved the `create_digest_jsonl()` function for better markdown file matching.
- Built a reliable execution daemon for pipelines, including idempotency checks and daemon loop logic.
- Developed a daemon orchestration structure and pipeline summary.
- Addressed import errors in [[Python]] scripts related to timezone handling.
- Implemented backfill mode for the daemon.
- Optimized loop logic for hourly processing.
- Fixed filename parsing issues and enhanced logging in the main function for digest generation.

### Achievements
- The automation script was thoroughly evaluated and improved for better performance and reliability.
- Several bugs and inefficiencies were identified and resolved, contributing to a more robust processing pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the enhanced daemon and digest processing logic.
- Continuous monitoring and refinement of the automation scripts to ensure long-term stability and efficiency.
