## üìÖ 2025-06-12 ‚Äî Session: Enhancement of JSON Structure and Automation Scripts

**üïí 03:30‚Äì04:35**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: JSON, Automation, Python, Data Processing, Promptflow  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance the [[JSON]] structure used in article organization and to develop automated scripts for [[data processing]] and prompt output handling.

### Key Activities
- **[[JSON]] Structure Review**: Reviewed the current [[JSON]] schema for organizing articles, focusing on thematic coherence, group validation, and redundancy elimination.
- **[[Automation]] Scripts**: Developed and improved [[Python]] scripts for automating Promptflow output processing, real-time logging, and [[data processing]].
  - **Promptflow Script**: Enhanced to allow real-time logging and added [[error handling]].
  - **[[Data Processing]] Script**: Automated the processing of `pfout_*.jsonl` files, extracting nested structures and generating output files for articles and seed ideas.
  - **[[Error Handling]]**: Addressed a syntax error in the [[Pandas]] `merge` function and provided a solution.

### Achievements
- Improved the coherence and efficiency of the [[JSON]] schema for articles.
- Automated key workflows in [[data processing]] and prompt output handling, reducing manual intervention.
- Enhanced [[error handling]] and logging capabilities in [[automation]] scripts.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement suggested enhancements for file processing efficiency in the [[data processing]] script.
- Validate and normalize data based on the evaluation of seed ideas for editorial content.
