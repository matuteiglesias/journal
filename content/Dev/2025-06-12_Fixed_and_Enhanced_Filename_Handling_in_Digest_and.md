### Session Goal
The main objective was to fix and enhance the filename handling in both digest generation and RSS feed processing scripts to ensure compatibility with downstream processes.

### Key Activities
- **Restored Window Label in Filename Prefix:** Implemented a solution to restore the window label in the filename prefix before saving digest files, ensuring filenames conform to the expected pattern.
- **Fixed Filename Prefix in Digest Generation:** Addressed a bug in the `01_digests.py` script affecting how digest files are saved, ensuring the filename prefix includes the window type label.
- **Updated [[CSV]] Filename Logic:** Revised the `__main__` block in [[Python]] to ensure each output [[CSV]] file includes the window label in its filename for consistent downstream processing.
- **Corrected Filename Handling in RSS [[Data Processing]]:** Made critical corrections to preserve window labels in filenames within the RSS [[data processing]] script.
- **Fixed RSS Feed Processing Logic:** Restored the filename return from the `fetch_and_save_news` function to maintain compatibility with downstream operations.
- **Tested RSS Pipeline:** Conducted testing of the RSS pipeline using [[Python]] commands, detailing expected output files and processes.
- **Enhanced [[Python]] Script with Argument Parsing:** Implemented command-line argument parsing using the argparse library for generating markdown and JSONL digests based on a given hour.

### Achievements
- Successfully fixed bugs related to filename handling in both digest and RSS processing scripts.
- Enhanced the scripts to include window labels in filenames, ensuring compatibility with downstream processes.
- Improved the testing process for the RSS pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing is required to ensure all edge cases are handled in the filename processing logic.
