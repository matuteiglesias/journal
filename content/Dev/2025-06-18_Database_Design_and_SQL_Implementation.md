## 📅 2025-06-18 — Session: Database Design and SQL Implementation

**🕒 16:25–17:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: ERD, Normalization, SQL, Database Design, Data Analysis  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on analyzing and improving database design, specifically through the use of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and SQL operations.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a critical analysis of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), identifying strong and weak entities, and mapping them to a relational model.
- Performed normalization of tables, including the CUENTA_CLIENTE table, and proposed improvements for decomposition into 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
- Created SQL queries for order details, total amounts per order, and total spending per user.
- Designed SQL tables for product analysis, including sales metrics aggregation.

### Achievements
- Successfully completed the mapping of ERDs to relational models and normalized the tables to improve database efficiency.
- Developed SQL scripts that facilitate comprehensive [[data analysis]] for e-commerce and product metrics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the relational model and additional normalization steps may be required.
- Implementation of SQL queries in a live database environment for testing and validation.
