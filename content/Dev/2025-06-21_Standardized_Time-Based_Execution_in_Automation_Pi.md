## 📅 2025-06-21 — Session: Standardized Time-Based Execution in Automation Pipeline

**🕒 22:25–22:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Automation, Scripting, Pipeline, Standardization, Timestamp, Bug_Fix  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to standardize time-based execution parameters in the automation pipeline to enhance orchestration and reduce fragmentation.

### Key Activities
- Proposed the adoption of a consistent `--trigger-time` interface across scripts.
- Reviewed the `03_headlines_digests.py` script for timestamp consistency and error reporting.
- Conducted an audit of the current system's timestamp policies and identified core inconsistencies.
- Implemented timestamp normalization in the `create_digest_jsonl()` function.
- Fixed bugs related to filename generation logic and redundant timestamps.
- Refactored the `STAGES` list to a function for dynamic timestamp handling.
- Diagnosed and validated pipeline output.

### Achievements
- Established a unified approach for time-based execution in automation scripts.
- Improved script compatibility and coordination across components.
- Enhanced the accuracy of filename generation and digest processing.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the implemented changes for any unforeseen issues.
- Continue improving the downstream filename parsing function.

### Outcome
The session successfully standardized execution parameters and implemented key improvements in the automation pipeline.
