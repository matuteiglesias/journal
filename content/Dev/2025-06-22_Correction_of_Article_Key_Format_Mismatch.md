## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Correction of Article Key Format Mismatch

**🕒 03:30–05:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data_processing, error_handling, python, article_key, file_management  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address and correct a technical issue involving a format mismatch between the `id_digest` field in `article_rows` and the `digest_file` in `master_ref.csv`.

### Key Activities
- Corrected the format mismatch between `id_digest` and `digest_file` to ensure proper matching of `article_key`.
- Clarified the correct source for `digest_file` and `window_type`, emphasizing the use of `digest_group_id`.
- Implemented robust parsing of JSONL files for [[data processing]], including [[error handling]].
- Improved file existence checks for [[PromptFlow]] execution to prevent false failure signals.
- Diagnosed and proposed solutions for format inconsistencies affecting `article_key`.
- Regenerated `master_index.csv` with improved data traceability.

### Achievements
- Successfully corrected the mismatched formats, ensuring accurate article key generation.
- Enhanced [[data processing]] scripts with better [[error handling]] and file management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing to ensure all edge cases are handled in the new logic.
- Documentation updates to reflect the changes in [[data processing]] scripts.
