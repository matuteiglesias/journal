## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Data Processing and Enrichment in Python

**🕒 20:25–21:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data Cleaning, Data Enrichment, Pandas, Python, Data Processing  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address various data processing challenges, including data cleaning, enrichment, and merging using [[Python]] and [[Pandas]].

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed and fixed issues with empty columns in the DataFrame `df_scraped` after loading a JSONL file.
- Enriched articles using `master_ref.csv`, constructing keys and merging data.
- Debugged key mismatches in DataFrame merges, ensuring consistent data types and validating key existence.
- Resolved a KeyError in DataFrame processing due to missing columns by constructing necessary keys.
- Finalized data merge in the pipeline with `scraped_data` using `index_id`.
- Handled NaN values in DataFrame columns using regex safely.
- Optimized DataFrame merge in [[Pandas]] to avoid column duplication.

### Achievements
Successfully addressed multiple data processing issues, ensuring data integrity and enhancing the data pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
No major pending tasks, but continued monitoring and optimization of data processes are recommended.
