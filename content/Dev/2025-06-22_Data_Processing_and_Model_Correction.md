**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to enhance data processing scripts and correct data modeling issues.

### Key Activities
- Created a combined data table for editorial content, integrating seed ideas with related articles.
- Developed a [[Python]] script to merge JSONL files into a DataFrame, focusing on filtering by specific idea IDs.
- Addressed inconsistencies in JSONL data formats, proposing a unified DataFrame for better organization.
- Proposed normalization adjustments for `id_digest` in data processing scripts to ensure consistency.
- Refactored a [[Python]] script for improved data processing, enhancing file handling and coherence of `id_digest`.
- Resolved merge issues in DataFrames by modifying scripts to include necessary columns from reference files.
- Analyzed and recommended corrections for an academic data model, focusing on relational modeling and normalization.

### Achievements
- Improved the robustness and consistency of data processing scripts.
- Enhanced the academic data model by correcting conceptual errors and proposing a relational model using ternary relationships.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed script modifications for merging datasets.
- Finalize the corrected academic data model for implementation.
