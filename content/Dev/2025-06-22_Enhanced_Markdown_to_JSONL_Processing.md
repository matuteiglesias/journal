## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Enhanced Markdown to JSONL Processing

**🕒 06:50–07:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: JSONL, Markdown, Python, Regex, File Processing, Debugging  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to diagnose and enhance the `create_digest_jsonl` function for processing Markdown files into JSONL format, ensuring robust parsing and error handling.

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed issues with the `create_digest_jsonl` function that were causing failures in processing `.md` files.
- Improved the function by adding better validation, logging, and error handling.
- Addressed problems with empty or short Markdown files by checking file content and debugging code.
- Diagnosed and corrected the `robust_parse_filename()` function to handle valid filenames and updated regex for timestamp formatting.
- Adjusted regex for filename parsing to ensure compatibility with `.md` extensions and improved error handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the `create_digest_jsonl` function to handle Markdown to JSONL conversion more robustly.
- Resolved issues with filename parsing and ensured correct handling of file naming conventions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the enhanced functions in different environments to ensure consistent performance.
