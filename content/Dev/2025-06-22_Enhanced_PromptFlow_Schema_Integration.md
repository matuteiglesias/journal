### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the integration and processing capabilities of [[PromptFlow]] by refining its data schema and processing methodologies.

### Key Activities
- Defined a relational model for integrating RSS dumps and [[PromptFlow]] outputs, focusing on table definitions and normalization.
- Proposed extensions to the relational model for new data structures, including articles and summaries.
- Developed a [[strategy]] for article management schema, emphasizing historical consistency and deduplication.
- Integrated robust article ID references into [[PromptFlow]], enhancing stability and traceability using a global reference layer.
- Implemented the `article_index_map` in the [[PromptFlow]] pipeline for better [[data processing]] and configuration updates.
- Enriched PF articles with unique identifiers and metadata, addressing missing metadata issues.
- Utilized a composite key for joining article metadata, ensuring accurate data merging.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the [[PromptFlow]] data schema to improve data integration and processing.
- Established a robust framework for managing and enriching article data within [[PromptFlow]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the new schema and processing methods in a live environment.
