## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Enhanced RSS Data Processing Pipeline

**🕒 05:35–06:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: RSS, Data Processing, Python, Debugging, CSV  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the RSS data processing pipeline by addressing various issues in data handling and script functionality.

### Key Activities
- Processed all available RSS data by bypassing the `trigger_time` logic and loading existing [[CSV]] dumps.
- Enhanced a digest generation script to process all [[CSV]] files in a directory by extracting unique digest IDs from filenames.
- Fixed structural issues in a [[Python]] script to ensure proper argument handling and logic placement.
- Addressed a ValueError in date parsing by diagnosing the issue and suggesting solutions.
- Diagnosed problems with the `article_id` field in the `save_digest_files()` function, providing steps to verify and correct the issue.

### Achievements
- Successfully processed RSS data and enhanced the digest generation script.
- Improved the structural integrity of [[Python]] scripts.
- Provided solutions for error handling in date parsing and `article_id` issues.

### Pending Tasks
- Further verification of `article_id` corrections in data processing.
- Continuous monitoring and testing of the enhanced scripts to ensure robustness.
