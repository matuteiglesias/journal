## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Enhancement and Refactoring of Data Processing Pipeline

**🕒 01:50–03:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Data_Processing, Refactoring, Pandas, Python, Pipeline  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the merge logic and refactor the data processing pipeline for improved data quality and efficiency.

### Key Activities
- Improved merge logic by using `index_id` as a unique identifier instead of `Title` to avoid ambiguity.
- Reconstructed the `rss_index` from `master_ref.csv` to ensure accurate data retrieval.
- Reviewed and provided recommendations for the construction of `rss_index` and `article_key` to address ambiguity issues.
- Diagnosed and resolved a missing `index_id` column error in DataFrame operations.
- Refactored the article enrichment pipeline to separate responsibilities and eliminate code duplication.
- Resolved a type error in DataFrame key generation by ensuring type consistency during concatenation.
- Addressed and resolved name conflict issues in DataFrame merges to ensure correct column generation.

### Achievements
- Successfully enhanced the merge logic and refactored the data processing pipeline.
- Improved data quality and processing efficiency.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the refactored pipeline to ensure robustness and handle edge cases.
