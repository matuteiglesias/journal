## 📅 2025-06-22 — Session: Resolved Data Merging and Processing Issues

**🕒 19:25–20:05**  
**🏷️ Labels**: data_processing, Python, CSV, debugging, data_quality, pipeline  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to diagnose and resolve issues related to data merging and processing, specifically focusing on editorial ideas and article associations.

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed merging issues in [[data processing]], identifying incorrect integration of editorial ideas with articles.
- Provided [[Python]] code snippets for merging JSONL and [[CSV]] files into a clean DataFrame, ensuring topic-level consistency.
- Corrected code to reconstruct the 'digest_file' column in DataFrames, addressing missing data issues.
- Proposed a [[strategy]] to reorganize the article pipeline for improved traceability and uniqueness of identifiers.
- Resolved an import error with the `glob` module in [[Python]], ensuring correct usage based on import style.
- Debugged [[CSV]] file processing, addressing the absence of the `master_index.csv` file.
- Improved [[CSV]] file processing by calculating `rel_path` correctly to ensure robust file identification.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved data merging issues and improved [[data processing]] scripts.
- Enhanced the robustness of the data pipeline and ensured consistency in data integration.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed [[strategy]] for pipeline reorganization to further enhance [[data processing]] efficiency.
