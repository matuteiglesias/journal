## 📅 2025-06-26 — Session: Entity-Relationship Modeling and Analysis

**🕒 00:00–01:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: ERD, database design, entity modeling, normalization, weak entity, ternary relationship  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and refine the modeling of academic databases using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), focusing on the representation and relationships of entities such as 'Cursada', 'Estudiante', 'Materia', and 'Cuatrimestre'.

### Key Activities
- **Formal Representation of ER Diagrams**: Discussed the depiction of entities, attributes, primary keys, and relationships with cardinalities.
- **Entity Modeling of Course Enrollment**: Conceptualized course enrollment as an independent entity with attributes and relationships.
- **Analysis of 'Cursa' Relationship**: Evaluated 'Cursa' as a ternary relationship, discussing its characteristics and potential modeling as a weak entity.
- **Modeling Weak Entities**: Analyzed the use of weak entities and identifying relationships in database design.
- **Relational Schema Generation**: Explored generating relational schemas from both ternary relationships and weak entities.
- **Normalization and Relational Design**: Reviewed relational design and normalization practices, focusing on dependencies and schema refinement.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of modeling 'Cursada' as either a weak entity or a ternary relationship.
- Identified the implications of different modeling approaches on database design and normalization.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of the impact of modeling choices on database performance and integrity.
- Implementation of the refined models into a practical database system.
