**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: automation, cognitive systems, project management, life management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and design frameworks for enhancing [[automation]] in life management and cognitive systems, focusing on minimizing user intervention and maximizing efficiency.

### Key Activities
- **Life Management Framework**: Developed a structured approach to distinguish between operational and creative work, aligning daily goals with meaningful projects.
- **System Resilience Design**: Created a blueprint for systems requiring minimal user oversight, incorporating [[automation]] and self-healing functionalities.
- **Daily Digest Mechanism**: Prototyped a [[workflow]] for generating daily digests from project files, emphasizing relevance and minimal manual effort.
- **Cognitive Reconstruction System**: Outlined a framework for a self-sustaining cognitive system using passive data for inference and activity tracking.
- **Minimal-Discipline Life Management**: Proposed a low-friction [[task management]] system using voice input and Google Docs.
- **Google Docs [[Automation]]**: Developed a prototype for integrating Google Docs with LLMs via service accounts for automated content management.
- **Self-Prompting Project System**: Designed a template for a self-prompting [[project management]] system.
- **Two-Layered Cognitive Storage**: Created a framework for cognitive storage with archival and actionable layers.
- **Project Identification and Categorization**: Assisted in categorizing personal projects for strategic management.
- **Project Canon Refactoring**: Refactored personal projects into a coherent structure for strategic autonomy.

### Achievements
- Developed multiple frameworks and prototypes for [[automation]] and cognitive systems.
- Enhanced strategic management of personal projects through structured categorization.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement and test the proposed [[automation]] systems and frameworks.
- Further refine the cognitive reconstruction system for better inference accuracy.
- Prototype the minimal-discipline life management system for practical use.
