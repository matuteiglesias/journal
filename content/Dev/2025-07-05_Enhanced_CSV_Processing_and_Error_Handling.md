## üìÖ 2025-07-05 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced CSV Processing and Error Handling

**üïí 20:30‚Äì20:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: CSV, Error Handling, Data Processing, Encoding, Automation  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal:
The session aimed to review and enhance the transaction data processing pipeline, focusing on error handling and encoding issues in [[CSV]] files, particularly from European banks.

### Key Activities:
- Reviewed the canonical transaction structure for potential improvements.
- Proposed a method for automatic detection of file encoding in non-UTF-8 [[CSV]] files using `pandas.read_csv`.
- Addressed file saving issues by ensuring necessary directories are created prior to file operations.
- Confirmed successful saving and standardization of Erste transaction files for system integration.
- Discussed common encoding issues in European bank [[CSV]] files and provided [[Python]] code for automatic detection and handling.
- Developed a complete pipeline in a notebook format for processing ERSTE account statements, including [[CSV]] reading, encoding handling, data cleaning, and canonical export.
- Analyzed [[CSV]] parsing errors due to unquoted commas and provided solutions using [[Pandas]].
- Outlined a tokenization strategy for handling [[CSV]] parsing issues with unquoted commas, ensuring data integrity.

### Achievements:
- Enhanced the data processing pipeline with robust error handling and encoding detection mechanisms.
- Successfully integrated Erste transaction files into the system.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the tokenization strategy on diverse [[CSV]] files to ensure robustness.
- Continuous improvement of the transaction structure based on feedback from the review.
