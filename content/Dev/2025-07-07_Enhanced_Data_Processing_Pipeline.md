**üïí 05:35‚Äì06:25**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data_Pipeline, Automation, Python, Error_Handling, Integration  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
To improve and integrate various components of a data processing pipeline, ensuring robustness, compatibility, and efficiency.

### Key Activities
- **[[Pipeline]] Fixes:** Addressed column name mismatches and directory misalignments to ensure smooth script execution.
- **[[Error Handling]]:** Implemented strategies to prevent the creation of empty [[CSV]] files, modifying three scripts for better error handling.
- **[[Integration]]:** Merged a JSONL exporter with a Selenium scraper, allowing for seamless data export without overwriting existing files.
- **[[Workflow]] Refinement:** Transitioned job scraping and classification to a selective model, improving efficiency by scraping only high-quality job postings.
- **Orchestrator Design:** Developed a modular orchestrator for pipeline execution, transforming existing scripts into a flexible driver with configurable paths.
- **Script Enhancement:** Updated the `02_label_and_score.py` script for orchestrator compatibility using `argparse` and functional wrapping.
- **[[Pipeline]] [[Integration]]:** Integrated a JSONL export step, updating the orchestrator's workflow to convert [[CSV]] data into JSONL format.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated and enhanced multiple components of the data processing pipeline.
- Improved error handling and compatibility across scripts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the integrated pipeline components.
- Exploration of additional enhancements for future scalability.
