### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to execute and debug various components of data processing pipelines, focusing on automation and error resolution.

### Key Activities
- Developed a strategic execution plan for scrappy agents with user configuration, automation, and monetization strategies.
- Provided strategic recommendations for productivity agents, including a Streamlit UI template for configuration uploads.
- Outlined a mid-sprint sanity plan for maintaining productivity during intense work periods.
- Reviewed the job search pipeline status and outlined next steps.
- Designed and executed the `run_full_pipeline.py` script for job data processing.
- Fixed argument mismatch in the `01_serp_scraper.py` script.
- Provided Bash commands for file management.
- Resolved a JSONL conversion error and diagnosed a JSONL output name mismatch.
- Debugged file path issues and enhanced subprocess command for live output.
- Improved error handling in the [[CSV]] processing pipeline.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented fixes for argument mismatches and JSONL conversion errors.
- Enhanced real-time logging and debugging capabilities.
- Improved robustness of [[CSV]] processing pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Further standardize naming patterns in data pipeline scripts to ensure compatibility with downstream processing.
