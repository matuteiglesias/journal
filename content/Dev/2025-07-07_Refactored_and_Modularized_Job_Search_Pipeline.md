**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refactor and modularize the job search pipeline for improved [[data processing]], [[automation]], and [[error handling]].

### Key Activities
- **Database Schema Design**: Outlined the database schema and relationships for the SERP scraper output, focusing on data extraction and job search.
- **Weakness Identification**: Analyzed the modular product structure to identify weaknesses in data integrity and processing, suggesting actionable fixes.
- **Pipeline Refinement**: Refined the job search [[automation]] pipeline by breaking it into logical stages and addressing weak points for better modularity.
- **Architectural Planning**: Developed a plan to split monolithic logic into distinct scripts, detailing their responsibilities and interactions.
- **Script Development**: Created and implemented [[Python]] scripts for fetching SERP data, labeling job domains, and converting [[CSV]] to JSONL formats.
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed a [[PromptFlow]] local path resolution error, enhancing local execution and [[error handling]].

### Achievements
- Developed a modular script `01_fetch_serp.py` for SERP [[data processing]].
- Implemented `02_label_and_score.py` for domain extraction and labeling.
- Completed a script for JSONL conversion of job search results.
- Resolved [[PromptFlow]] path resolution error.

### Pending Tasks
- Integrate real scraping logic into `01_fetch_serp.py`.
- Define batching rules and ensure output schema consistency.
- Decide on the format for Stage 3 focusing on JSONL export.
