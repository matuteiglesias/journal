### Session Goal
The session focused on developing a command-line interface (CLI) for the Terra Assistant, aiming to enhance productization and streamline user interaction through both CLI and web UI components.

### Key Activities
- Outlined a productization [[strategy]] for Terra Assistant, including CLI and web onboarding, installation scripts, and packaging.
- Proposed a CLI-first design approach, detailing the structure and its integration with UI actions.
- Created a CLI scaffold named `terra_assistant_cli.py` with placeholders for commands such as `init`, `fetch_emails`, and `triage_emails`.
- Implemented key commands for the Email Assistant CLI, including setup, configuration validation, and email fetching.
- Tested CLI commands for email fetching functions, covering setup, validation, and advanced scenarios.
- Fixed a misalignment issue in the `init()` function related to email configuration.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and tested the CLI scaffold and commands for Terra Assistant.
- Resolved configuration issues, ensuring alignment with the `config_template.yaml` structure.

### Pending Tasks
- Further integration with web UI components.
- [[Deployment]] and user testing of the CLI and UI components.
