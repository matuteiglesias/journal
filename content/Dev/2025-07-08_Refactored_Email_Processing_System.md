### Session Goal
The session focused on refactoring the email processing system to improve its architecture, modularity, and maintainability.

### Key Activities
- Developed strategic paths for a lean MVP application, emphasizing a config-driven CLI compatible with a daemon infrastructure.
- Integrated email processing into the `alive.py` daemon system, enabling continuous email fetching, triaging, and routing.
- Finalized the `alive.py` daemon with features like scheduling, logging, and background execution.
- Refactored workflows for the email pipeline by consolidating different versions into a new `workflows.py` script.
- Improved the architecture by separating concerns among agents, managers, and orchestrators.
- Refactored the code structure for the email management system, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- Received feedback on the email processing framework iteration, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.

### Achievements
- Established a clear strategy for the MVP and email processing system.
- Enhanced the modularity and production readiness of the email processing framework.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the feedback to further enhance the framework's modularity and readiness for production.
