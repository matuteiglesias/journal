## 📅 2025-07-09 — Session: Enhancing PromptFlow Output and Integration

**🕒 16:20–16:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: PromptFlow, data auditability, pipeline integration, page_uid, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the [[PromptFlow]] output and integration, focusing on improving data auditability and integration into a modular pipeline.

### Key Activities
- Validated and improved [[PromptFlow]] run outputs.
- Adjusted schemas for better traceability.
- Integrated stable `page_uid` in [[data processing]] scripts for deduplication and traceability.
- Incorporated `page_uid` into labeling and scoring scripts.
- Added `page_uid` to [[PromptFlow]] DAG and Run configuration files.
- Fixed execution snippets and errors in [[Python]] scripts related to [[data processing]] and scoring.

### Achievements
- Enhanced data auditability and semantic structuring in [[PromptFlow]].
- Improved traceability and deduplication in [[data processing]].
- Successfully integrated `page_uid` across various scripts and configurations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the [[PromptFlow]] integration and schema adjustments as needed.
