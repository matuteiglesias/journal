**üïí 14:50‚Äì16:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Script Optimization, QA, Pipeline  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to refactor and enhance the [[data processing]] pipeline scripts to improve flexibility, maintainability, and robustness.

### Key Activities
- **Fixed Hardcoded Output Directory**: Updated the `09_run_promptflow.py` script to generalize the output directory lookup, enabling dynamic glob pattern generation based on flow names.
- **Parameterization of Legacy Paths**: Transitioned [[Python]] scripts to use parameterized paths instead of hardcoded values, enhancing directory management.
- **Modular Update for Pipeline Orchestration**: Updated the `main()` function for better modularization and avoidance of hardcoded references.
- **Revised Directory Naming Strategy**: Implemented a structured directory naming [[strategy]] for better project organization.
- **Directory Structure Setup for Selenium Scraping**: Defined new `Path` variables for consistent output directory organization for Selenium scraping and [[PromptFlow]] model scoring.
- **QA Guide and Report**: Developed a QA guide for the JobAI pipeline datasets and evaluated the `00_csv_raw` dataset for quality assurance.
- **Justification for JSONL and [[CSV]] Outputs**: Provided strategic reasoning for maintaining both JSONL and [[CSV]] outputs.
- **Log Quality Assurance and Row ID Renaming**: Proposed improvements for log data quality and field naming.
- **Filtering Quality Evaluation**: Assessed the filtering logic in the `label_scored` file to ensure efficient [[data processing]].
- **Script Optimization**: Suggested improvements for script robustness, including query identifier addition and column normalization.
- **Hash Computation Consistency**: Ensured consistent hash computation across pipeline stages.
- **Structured Reflection and Enhancements**: Analyzed the semantic enhancement script within the job intelligence [[workflow]].
- **Upgraded `main()` Function**: Enhanced the `main()` function with features like structured logging and configurable debug support.
- **Export Script Upgrade**: Improved the `02b_export_results_to_jsonl.py` script for better logging and directory handling.

### Achievements
- Improved the flexibility and maintainability of the [[data processing]] pipeline.
- Enhanced the robustness and organization of scripts and directory structures.
- Established a comprehensive QA framework for [[data processing]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further improvements to downstream processes as suggested in the modular update.
- Implementation of proposed log data quality improvements.

### Conclusion
The session successfully refactored and enhanced multiple components of the [[data processing]] pipeline, setting a foundation for future improvements.
