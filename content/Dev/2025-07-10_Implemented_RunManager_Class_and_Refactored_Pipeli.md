## 📅 2025-07-10 — Session: Implemented RunManager Class and Refactored Pipeline

**🕒 18:45–19:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Runmanager, Python, Automation, Refactoring, Data Pipeline  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to design and implement a `RunManager` class to manage runs, paths, outputs, and statuses in a [[Python]]-based data processing pipeline. Additionally, the session aimed to refactor existing scripts to integrate this new class and improve the overall architecture.

### Key Activities
- Designed the `RunManager` class to handle data fetching runs, including methods for checking file existence, reading logs, retrieving outputs, and handling metadata.
- Generated the `RunManager` class file located at `/utils/run_manager.py`, ready for import and use in Streamlit tabs.
- Proposed and initiated a refactoring of path management in the data pipeline to use sandboxed per-run folders instead of global directories.
- Evaluated architectural design and outlined integration steps for the `RunManager` in the data processing application.
- Refactored the `10_run_full_pipeline.py` script to incorporate the `RunManager` structure, focusing on modularity and run-specific paths.
- Made final adjustments to the pipeline script, including fixing variable references, storing metadata, and improving logging.
- Validated the integration of the `RunManager` and `make_run_dir(run_uid)` components, suggesting enhancements for error handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented the `RunManager` class and integrated it into the data processing pipeline.
- Improved the script's modularity and path management, enhancing organization and multi-user functionality.

### Pending Tasks
- Minor enhancements for error handling in the `RunManager` integration.
- Further UX redesign proposals for the job search application.
