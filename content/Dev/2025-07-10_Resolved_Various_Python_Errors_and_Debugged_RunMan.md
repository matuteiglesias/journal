## 📅 2025-07-10 — Session: Resolved Various Python Errors and Debugged RunManager

**🕒 21:10–21:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Error Handling, Runmanager, Debugging, Streamlit  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to resolve various [[Python]] errors and improve the debugging process for the RunManager pipeline.

### Key Activities
- **Resolved IsADirectoryError**: Addressed an error caused by attempting to open a directory as a file. Provided solutions for handling file downloads correctly.
- **Managed Streamlit Input States**: Implemented strategies to manage input states in Streamlit applications, ensuring user input is preserved during reruns.
- **Debugged Metadata Persistence**: Diagnosed and solved issues related to missing metadata in the RunManager, ensuring metadata is not overwritten during pipeline execution.
- **Fixed FileNotFoundError**: Modified the `save_metadata` method in the `RunManager` class to prevent errors when saving metadata files without existing directories.
- **Addressed Critical Path Mismatch**: Diagnosed and fixed issues with the `meta.json` file not being read correctly in the RunManager, leading to pipeline execution errors.
- **Resolved Timestamp Mismatch**: Provided fixes for timestamp mismatch issues in the data pipeline, ensuring consistent metadata handling.
- **Compared Query Handling Versions**: Analyzed differences between old and new query handling methods, identifying reliance on metadata as a potential failure point.
- **Aligned Modular [[Pipeline]] with Monolithic Script**: Corrected and aligned the modular pipeline code with the monolithic script, focusing on I/O paths and metadata propagation.
- **Fixed File Handling in [[Python]] Script**: Addressed errors related to file handling by implementing defensive programming techniques.
- **Debugged File Download Link Function**: Identified and proposed fixes for errors in the `file_download_link` function related to incorrect file handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple [[Python]] errors and improved the robustness of the RunManager pipeline.
- Enhanced the management of Streamlit input states, preserving user input across sessions.
- Improved error handling and defensive programming practices in [[Python]] scripts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the RunManager pipeline to ensure all metadata issues are resolved.
- Continuous monitoring of Streamlit applications to refine input management strategies.
