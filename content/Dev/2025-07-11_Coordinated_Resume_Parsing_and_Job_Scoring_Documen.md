### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to coordinate the development and [[documentation]] of two key pages: `resume-parsing.md` and `job-scoring-and-ranking.md`. These pages are crucial for guiding users through the job evaluation process using [[AI]].

### Key Activities
- **Coordinating Documentation:** Structured the content for two complementary [[documentation]] pages focusing on resume parsing and job scoring.
- **User Experience Design:** Emphasized the importance of user onboarding and customization, using Jinja2 and [[JSON]] schema, to enhance user experience and prevent overwhelm.
- **Technical and UX Clarity:** Mapped out the technical flexibility and UX clarity needed for assistant customization, ensuring users can effectively navigate the job scoring system without traditional resume uploads.
- **Job Scoring Mechanism Overview:** Provided a detailed breakdown of the job scoring and ranking mechanism, including heuristics and LLM integration.

### Achievements
- Developed a clear structure for the [[documentation]] pages that differentiate between resume parsing and job scoring.
- Enhanced user guidance through reframed [[documentation]] that facilitates user understanding of the [[AI]] job scorer.
- Provided comprehensive guides on customization and interpreting job match results.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the onboarding [[strategy]] [[documentation]] to ensure smooth user transition from consumers to designers/operators.
- Continue refining the customization pages to enhance user [[education]] and experience.
