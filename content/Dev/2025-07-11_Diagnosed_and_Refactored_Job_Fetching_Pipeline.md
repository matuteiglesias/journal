## 📅 2025-07-11 — Session: Diagnosed and Refactored Job Fetching Pipeline

**🕒 14:45–15:55**  
**🏷️ Labels**: pipeline, debugging, metadata, automation, job fetching  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to diagnose and resolve pipeline failures in the job fetching [[automation]] script, particularly focusing on metadata handling and query construction.

### Key Activities
- Diagnosed pipeline failure related to metadata loading and saving.
- Updated the CLI `__main__` block to include metadata fallback mechanisms.
- Fixed the missing `input_csv` issue in the metadata.
- Clarified design constraints for pipeline execution, making `--query` optional.
- Refactored CLI argument handling to reduce redundancy and improve metadata compliance.
- Debugged script execution failures, enhancing error reporting and input handling.
- Refined the [[Python]] script structure for better development [[workflow]].
- Fixed geographic targeting in job search queries and ensured proper query construction for the Remotive [[API]].

### Achievements
- Successfully diagnosed and resolved the pipeline failure issues.
- Improved the robustness of the job fetching [[automation]] script.
- Enhanced [[error handling]] and input validation for better reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the refactored script to ensure stability and performance.
- Continuous monitoring of the pipeline to catch any new issues early.
