## 📅 2025-07-13 — Session: Enhanced Error Handling and Dependency Management

**🕒 20:00–20:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Streamlit, Error Handling, PromptFlow, Python, Subprocess  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to enhance [[error handling]] in a Streamlit application and resolve dependency management issues with [[PromptFlow]].

### Key Activities
- Implemented improvements for error visibility and output handling in a Streamlit application using subprocesses.
- Refactored the `run_step()` function to improve [[error handling]] and ensure proper output display.
- Troubleshot and resolved installation errors and version mismatches with [[PromptFlow]] tools.
- Diagnosed and fixed issues related to importing `promptflow.tools` in different environments.
- Corrected the `PYTHONPATH` setting in the `run_step` function to ensure proper module path resolution.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the robustness of the Streamlit application by improving [[error handling]] mechanisms.
- Successfully resolved version mismatch and import issues with [[PromptFlow]] components.

### Pending Tasks
- Monitor the Streamlit application for any further [[error handling]] improvements.
- Continuously check for updates in [[PromptFlow]] and adjust dependency management strategies accordingly.
