## üìÖ 2025-07-13 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Python Environment and Deployment Security

**üïí 22:00‚Äì22:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, Streamlit, Deployment, Security, Api Management  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to improve the portability of [[Python]] environments for demos and enhance the security of deployments, particularly focusing on [[API]] key management and deployment on Streamlit Cloud.

### Key Activities
- **[[Python]] Environment Portability**: Explored the risks of mixed conda and system [[Python]] setups and recommended using `venv` for better compatibility in demo and deployment scenarios.
- **Streamlit App [[Deployment]]**: Provided a guide for deploying Streamlit applications on Streamlit Cloud, including repository preparation and deployment settings.
- **PromptFlow [[Deployment]]**: Addressed the `ConnectionNotFoundError` in PromptFlow on Streamlit Cloud, offering solutions for connection configuration and error handling.
- **[[API]] Key Security**: Outlined best practices for secure [[API]] key deployment in PromptFlow, emphasizing avoiding hard-coded secrets.
- **GitHub Security**: Offered a workflow to remove a committed secret from a GitHub repository and ensure future security by dynamically loading the [[API]] key.

### Achievements
- Established a more robust and portable [[Python]] environment setup.
- Improved deployment practices for Streamlit apps and PromptFlow, focusing on security and error resolution.
- Enhanced [[API]] key management and security in both local and cloud environments.

### Pending Tasks
- Continuous monitoring and testing of deployment setups to ensure ongoing security and functionality.
