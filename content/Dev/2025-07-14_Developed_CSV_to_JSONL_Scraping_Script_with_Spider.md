### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a [[Python]] script for web scraping, converting data from [[CSV]] to JSONL format using the Spider [[API]].

### Key Activities

- Implemented error handling and environment variable management.
- Addressed a RuntimeError with PromptFlow by installing a fallback keyring backend and configuring environment variables.
- Resolved integration issues between Streamlit and PromptFlow CLI, ensuring proper environment variable handling.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a Spider-based web scraper that reads from [[CSV]] files and outputs JSONL.
- Implemented robust error handling and logging.
- Ensured secure handling of [[API]] keys through environment variable configuration.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the scraping script in different environments.
- Continuous monitoring of the integration between Streamlit and PromptFlow CLI.
