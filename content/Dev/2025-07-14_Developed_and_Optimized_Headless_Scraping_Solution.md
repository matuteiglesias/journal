### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance and optimize web scraping techniques using headless browsers, focusing on automation and efficiency.

### Key Activities
- **Fixed Clipboard Issues**: Addressed `pyperclip.paste()` failures in headless Chrome by using Selenium for HTML extraction.
- **Job [[Data Extraction]]**: Developed strategies for extracting job information using [[JSON]]-LD and HTML snippets.
- **Streamlit App Alternatives**: Explored alternatives for text extraction beyond Streamlit limitations.
- **[[Automation]] Strategies**: Planned various approaches for automating web content extraction using browser extensions and desktop apps.
- **Cloud-Based Scraping**: Outlined the setup for cloud services using headless browsers.
- **Resource Usage Reflection**: Analyzed the resource demands of headless browsers for scaling.
- **Scaling Strategies**: Planned scaling for real browsing simulation using headless browsers.
- **[[API]] [[Development]]**: Set up a headless browser scraper [[API]] with FastAPI and Playwright.
- **Testing and [[Debugging]]**: Tested scrapers on JavaScript-heavy pages and resolved DNS errors.
- **Microservice [[Development]]**: Built and Dockerized a headless scraping microservice.
- **Cookie Consent Handling**: Implemented multilingual consent handling and refactored code for better management.
- **Spider [[API]] Investigation**: Explored Spider [[API]] capabilities for handling dynamic content and anti-bot systems.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and tested a headless browser scraper [[API]].
- Developed a scalable solution for web scraping using cloud services.
- Implemented effective cookie consent handling across languages.

### Pending Tasks
- Further investigation into Spider [[API]]'s full capabilities and integration.
- Continuous optimization of resource usage in headless browsers.
