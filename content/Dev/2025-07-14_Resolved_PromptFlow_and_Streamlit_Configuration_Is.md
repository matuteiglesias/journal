**üïí 00:10‚Äì01:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: PromptFlow, Streamlit, Selenium, Web Scraping, Debugging  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to address and resolve various configuration and deployment issues related to [[PromptFlow]] and Streamlit applications.

### Key Activities
- **YAML Schema Alignment**: Adjusted YAML configuration files to match [[PromptFlow]]'s expected schema.
- **Error Resolution**: Resolved `StoreConnectionEncryptionKeyError` in [[PromptFlow]] by setting up a fallback backend for secret storage.
- **BYOK [[Deployment]] Fix**: Implemented a minimum viable fix for deploying [[PromptFlow]] with user-supplied keys in a BYOK environment.
- **Environment Setup**: Configured environment variables for a Streamlit app to avoid keyring errors.
- **Browser [[Automation]]**: Developed strategies for handling browser [[automation]] issues in headless environments using Selenium and Playwright.
- **[[Debugging]] Techniques**: Explored methods for accessing live consoles for [[debugging]] deployed applications.
- **Streamlit [[Debugging]]**: Created a Streamlit debugger page with an embedded REPL and a lightweight debug console.
- **Code Restructuring**: Refactored Streamlit application code for better modularity using a `render()` function.
- **[[Web Scraping]] [[Automation]]**: Transitioned Selenium scripts to fully headless mode and updated WebDriver setup for cloud environments.

### Achievements
- Successfully aligned YAML configurations for [[PromptFlow]] connections.
- Resolved encryption key storage issues in [[PromptFlow]].
- Deployed [[PromptFlow]] with BYOK securely.
- Set up environment variables to enhance Streamlit app stability.
- Improved browser [[automation]] reliability in headless setups.
- Enhanced [[debugging]] capabilities for Streamlit applications.
- Streamlined web scraping scripts for headless execution.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of Streamlit [[debugging]] features in production environments.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of Selenium WebDriver setups as new versions are released.
