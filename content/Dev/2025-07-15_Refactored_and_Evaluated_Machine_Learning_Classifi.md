### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to refine, implement, and evaluate various [[machine learning]] classifiers to improve their performance, particularly focusing on handling class imbalance and optimizing model selection.

### Key Activities
- Refined the `fit_model` function to include an evaluation integration, allowing for modular evaluation across different model types (classification and regression).
- Implemented 1-vs-Rest classification for multiclass variables using Scikit-learn, enhancing the model's ability to handle multiclass scenarios.
- Refactored code to support multi-target classification with per-column diagnostics, improving the independent evaluation of each target variable.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of class imbalance issues in model predictions, with recommendations for using techniques like SMOTE.
- Evaluated the performance of various classifiers, including those for marital status, income prediction, and labor market analysis, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
- Explored the impact of `class_weight='balanced'` on classification results, assessing its effect on accuracy, recall, and precision.
- Proposed replacing RandomForestClassifier with Gradient Boosting Models like XGBoost and LightGBM for better performance in structured data scenarios.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated evaluation functions into the model fitting process.
- Improved understanding of class imbalance impacts on model performance and identified strategies to mitigate these issues.
- Identified key areas for model improvement and [[optimization]], particularly through the use of advanced ensemble methods.

### Pending Tasks
- Further tuning of gradient boosting models to ensure optimal performance.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of class weights to maintain balanced model predictions.
