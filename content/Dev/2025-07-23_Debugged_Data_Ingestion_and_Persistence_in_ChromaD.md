**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to data ingestion and persistence in ChromaDB using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- **[[Troubleshooting]] Empty Vectors and Nodes**: Implemented a systematic approach to diagnose and fix the issue of empty vectors and nodes returned from `load_vectors_and_nodes(coll)` function.
- **Resolving False-Positive Cache Hits**: Addressed the problem of false-positive cache hits during data ingestion, ensuring correct processing of files and saving of vectors.
- **Ensuring Full Data Retrieval**: Developed a [[Python]] function to adjust retrieval limits for complete data loading from ChromaDB collections.
- **Diagnosing Empty Collection**: Executed a checklist to diagnose zero count issues in Chroma collections, identifying potential data addition problems.
- **Fixing Directory and Collection Name Issues**: Identified and resolved mismatches in directory and collection names causing empty databases on rerun.
- **[[Debugging]] Persistent Collection Loading**: Analyzed and fixed code issues related to the deletion of Chroma collection directories, ensuring data persistence.

### Achievements
- Successfully debugged and resolved multiple issues related to data ingestion and persistence in ChromaDB.
- Implemented fixes for cache hit mismatches and ensured full data retrieval.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the implemented solutions to ensure robustness across different datasets and scenarios.
