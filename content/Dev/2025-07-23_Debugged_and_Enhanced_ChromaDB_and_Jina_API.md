## 📅 2025-07-23 — Session: Debugged and Enhanced ChromaDB and Jina API

**🕒 08:00–08:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Jina Api, Chromadb, Debugging, Error Handling, Python  
**📂 Project**: Dev  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The main objective of this session was to address and resolve issues related to oversized embeddings in the Jina [[API]] and various bugs in ChromaDB.

### Key Activities
- Implemented a try-catch mechanism in Jina [[API]] to handle oversized string embeddings, ensuring entries exceeding the token limit are skipped and logged for review.
- Diagnosed and resolved Chroma backend corruption issues by checking internal consistency, resetting the client, and rebuilding the store.
- Clarified the correct usage of the `include` parameter in the `coll.get(...)` function, providing code examples for correct ID retrieval.
- Created a checklist for loading vectors and nodes from a collection, ensuring successful execution of the `load_vectors_and_nodes(coll)` function.
- Fixed a bug in ChromaDB's `get(limit=N)` function to avoid issues with corrupted ID indexing by providing a patch for consistent data retrieval.
- Troubleshot ChromaDB `InternalError` by identifying causes such as index corruption and offering solutions like batch data fetching and index rebuilding.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented solutions for handling oversized embeddings in Jina [[API]].
- Resolved several bugs and inconsistencies in ChromaDB, improving data retrieval and error handling.

### Pending Tasks
- Review logged oversized embeddings in Jina [[API]] for further optimization.
- Monitor ChromaDB for any recurring issues to ensure stability.
