**üïí 18:00‚Äì18:50**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Python, ChromaDB, Installation, Compatibility, Error Handling  
**üìÇ Project**: Dev  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to address and resolve various installation and compatibility issues related to [[Python]] libraries used in the project, particularly focusing on embedding processes and metadata handling in ChromaDB.

### Key Activities
- **Running and Verifying Daily Log Embedding:** Executed the embedding script for daily logs and verified successful embedding, troubleshooting edge cases.
- **Fixing Installation Issues for Cerebrum Module:** Resolved issues related to missing LICENSE files and ModuleNotFoundError during the installation of the Cerebrum module.
- **Installing Sentence Transformers:** Installed the `sentence-transformers` library using pip, with considerations for virtual environments.
- **Resolving Version Incompatibility:** Addressed version incompatibility between `sentence-transformers` and `huggingface_hub` by downgrading the latter.
- **Resolving Compatibility Issues in Hugging Face Libraries:** Managed compatibility issues affecting `sentence-transformers` and `transformers`, ensuring a stable environment.
- **Improving Metadata Handling in ChromaDB:** Enhanced [[error handling]] in ChromaDB by filtering out `None` values and logging warnings.
- **Embedding Process and [[Error Handling]] Improvement:** Successfully executed embedding steps, fixed issues with malformed metadata, and improved the `add_document()` function to prevent crashes.

### Achievements
- Successfully resolved multiple installation and compatibility issues across different [[Python]] libraries.
- Improved the stability and reliability of the embedding process in ChromaDB.

### Pending Tasks
- Continue monitoring library updates for potential compatibility issues.
- Implement additional logging for metadata handling to catch and address future anomalies.
