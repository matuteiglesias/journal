## 📅 2024-04-27 — Session: Developed Nutritional Tracking Framework and Clustering

**🕒 14:55–17:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Nutrition, Diet, Clustering, Data_Analysis, Macronutrients  
**📂 Project**: Health  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine nutritional tracking methods and explore clustering techniques for categorizing food items by macronutrient profiles.

### Key Activities
- Developed the 'Dosis-Antidote Nutritional Balancing Method' to manage dietary intake flexibly over time.
- Compiled generic names and nutritional estimates for chicken and pork cuts, emphasizing differences between raw and cooked states.
- Analyzed nutritional database entries for chicken, pork, potatoes, and beef to ensure accurate tracking of caloric and macronutrient content.
- Implemented a clustering analysis using KMeans to group food items by macronutrient profiles, utilizing PCA for visualization and insights.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for nutritional tracking using the 'Dosis-Antidote' method.
- Clarified nutritional differences in various food states and cuts, aiding in precise dietary management.
- Successfully clustered food items into distinct groups, enhancing understanding of macronutrient distributions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the clustering model to improve accuracy and interpretability.
- Integrate findings into a broader nutritional management system for continuous dietary optimization.
