### Key Activities

- Developed a reorganized SOAP note template specifically for Tasy, focusing on enhancing traceability and clarity.
- Created structured SOAP notes for documenting post-operative statuses for vasectomy and tubal ligation procedures.

### Achievements

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and feedback collection on the usability and effectiveness of the new templates in clinical settings.
