### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to explore and implement methods for automating web searches related to job roles using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- Discussed the limitations of executing web searches and scraping websites directly from [[Python]] scripts due to environmental constraints, and suggested a manual approach for job searches.
- Outlined a [[Python]] script using the `googlesearch` library for automated web searches, including setup instructions and ethical considerations.
- Provided a [[Python]] function using the `urllib.parse` library to extract domain names from a list of URLs, aiding in processing job search results.
- Developed a [[Python]] script to create a DataFrame mapping job roles to their domain names by iterating over roles and domain names.
- Described a [[Python]] function for generating Indeed job search URLs based on specified roles and locations, with examples for Buenos Aires and Florian√≥polis.

### Achievements
- Successfully created scripts for automating job search tasks using [[Python]], including web search automation, domain extraction, and DataFrame creation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the scripts to ensure robustness and compliance with ethical web scraping practices.
