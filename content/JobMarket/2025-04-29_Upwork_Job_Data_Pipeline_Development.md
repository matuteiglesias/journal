### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop a robust pipeline for scraping and extracting job data from Upwork using their GraphQL [[API]].

### Key Activities
- Followed a step-by-step guide to manually reproduce job scraping calls using [[JavaScript]] in the browser DevTools Console.
- Debugged a TypeError encountered when calling the Upwork [[API]], providing troubleshooting steps and a simplified code snippet.
- Successfully accessed Upwork's GraphQL [[API]] to retrieve job data, including job titles and descriptions, and provided a method to print a clean job list.
- Provided a [[JavaScript]] code snippet for downloading the raw [[JSON]] data of Upwork job feeds using a GraphQL query.
- Resolved an error related to fetching user saved searches from the Upwork [[API]], including improved [[error handling]] and [[debugging]].
- Fixed errors in a GraphQL query for Upwork's [[API]] by suggesting a corrected query that only includes defined fields in the schema.
- Successfully authenticated and extracted job data from Upwork's GraphQL [[API]], enabling the creation of a structured dataset for further analysis and [[automation]].
- Outlined methods for automating job scraping from Upwork using a Chrome extension, a Tampermonkey script, and a [[Python]] script with Selenium.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of Upwork's GraphQL [[API]] and job data extraction process.
- Created a structured dataset for job [[data analysis]] and [[automation]].

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the outlined [[automation]] methods for job scraping from Upwork.
