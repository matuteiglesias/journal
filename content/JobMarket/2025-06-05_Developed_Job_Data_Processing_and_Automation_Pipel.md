### Session Goal
The primary objective of this session was to enhance the [[data processing]] and [[automation]] pipelines related to job listings, focusing on modular design and efficient data handling.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a data quality review for job listings [[CSV]] files to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
- Designed a modular code structure for [[CSV]] processing in [[Python]], enabling batch processing and efficient file handling.
- Implemented a modular web scraping pipeline using Selenium, focusing on unprocessed rows and saving results as JSONL.
- Evaluated JSONL structure for scraped content and designed a modular annotator pipeline for enriching job records.
- Developed a structured prompt for [[AI]] annotator to screen job postings and refined a [[JSON]] schema for job posting categorization.
- Integrated job postings into the [[PromptFlow]] pipeline and refined Jinja2 prompt templates for job screening.
- Analyzed [[JSON]] object structures for screening pipelines and developed a [[JSON]] schema for webpage classification.
- Improved employer detection in the `label_and_score` function and created a [[CSV]] to JSONL conversion script in [[Python]].

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and implemented modular pipelines for [[data processing]] and [[automation]].
- Enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of job data handling and screening processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and [[optimization]] of the pipelines to ensure robustness and scalability.
- [[Integration]] of additional data sources and refinement of the [[JSON]] schemas for broader application.
