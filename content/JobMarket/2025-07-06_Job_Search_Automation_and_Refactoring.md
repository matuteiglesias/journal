### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the job search automation pipeline by setting up a structured project directory, updating the pipeline scope, and refactoring legacy code into a modular script-based architecture.

### Key Activities
- **Project Directory Setup**: Created a structured project directory for job search automation using terminal commands.
- **Project Evolution Analysis**: Analyzed project evolution for ATS and ATS2 directories to understand workspace organization and data analysis.
- **Updated Job Search Pipeline**: Outlined an updated structure and functionality for a job search pipeline, focusing on portability and ease of use.
- **Numbered Script Convention**: Adopted a numbered script convention to enhance clarity and modularity.
- **Refactor Plan**: Developed a plan to refactor legacy notebooks into a modular script-based architecture.
- **Module Mapping**: Updated module mapping for legacy notebooks to improve modularization.
- **Notebook Overview**: Outlined the functionality of a [[Jupyter]] notebook for job posting integration.
- **Modular Merge Script Design**: Designed a modular merge script for job postings.
- **PromptFlow System Design**: Implemented a modular PromptFlow system to enhance automation.
- **[[Python]] Wrapper for PromptFlow**: Created a [[Python]] wrapper for PromptFlow to manage job application processes programmatically.
- **Error Diagnosis**: Diagnosed and proposed solutions for a `FileNotFoundError` in a [[Python]] script.
- **[[Debugging]] Techniques**: Analyzed traceback and network request issues in job search scripts.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive directory structure for job search automation.
- Improved pipeline scope and modularity.
- Enhanced error diagnosis and debugging techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the refactored scripts and test the updated pipeline.
- Finalize the modular merge script and integrate it into the pipeline.
