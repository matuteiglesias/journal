## üìÖ 2025-06-12 ‚Äî Session: Enhanced Article Scraping Process

**üïí 05:10‚Äì05:40**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: scraping, automation, Python, data processing, content strategy  
**üìÇ Project**: Media  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to refine and enhance the article scraping logic and process to improve efficiency and accuracy.

### Key Activities
1. **Refinement Proposal for Article Scraping Logic**: Reviewed and proposed enhancements for the article scraping process using a post-[[PromptFlow]] dataset, including changes in logic and an updated scraper script.
2. **Script Extension for Data Enrichment**: Proposed an extension for the `explode_pf_outputs.py` script to merge data from `master_ref.csv` and `scraped_links.jsonl`, creating an enriched [[CSV]] file `articles_to_scrape.csv`.
3. **Adaptation of Article Scraper**: Adapted a script for scraping articles from a JSONL file, using 'index_id' as the primary key and avoiding recalculation of 'uid'.
4. **Modification for Complete Processing**: Modified the `main()` method and CLI to process the entire file without date or time filters, using `index_id` to prevent duplicates.
5. **Reinforcement of `index_id` Use**: Finalized the script to use `index_id` as the sole identifier, ensuring idempotency and consistency.
6. **Review of Scraping Pipeline**: Conducted a review of the scraping pipeline, highlighting its current state and suggesting improvements for robustness and modularity.
7. **News Intelligence System Status**: Detailed the progress and components for developing a semi-autonomous content generation and curation system.
8. **Content Generation Strategy**: Described a [[workflow]] for transforming seed ideas into strategic content and drafts using an automated system.

### Achievements
- Enhanced the article scraping process with improved logic and enriched data handling.
- Established a robust system using `index_id` for consistent and idempotent scraping.
- Reviewed and suggested improvements for the scraping pipeline.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed improvements and test the enhanced scraping pipeline.
- Complete the development of the semi-autonomous content generation system.
