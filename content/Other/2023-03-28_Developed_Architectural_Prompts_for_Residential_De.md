**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and refine prompts for generating architectural blueprints and detailed designs for residential buildings using [[AI]] tools like Midjourney.

### Key Activities
- Designed a blueprint for a residential building floor with specific apartment configurations.
- Created prompts for freestanding residential house plans, detailing unit types and dimensions.
- Developed prompts for a residential building complex with specified amenities.
- Updated prompts for generating architectural plans for a freestanding residential building complex.
- Formulated a Midjourney prompt for a detailed house plan for a six-floor residential building.
- Provided prompts for using Midjourney to generate 3D renderings, cost estimates, and energy efficiency analyses.
- Discussed the limitations of [[AI]] in providing cost estimates for building construction and recommended consulting professionals for accurate estimates.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a series of prompts for architectural designs that can be used in [[AI]] tools to generate detailed blueprints and visualizations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of prompts to enhance specificity and usability in [[AI]] design tools.
- Exploration of additional [[AI]] tools for improved architectural design capabilities.
