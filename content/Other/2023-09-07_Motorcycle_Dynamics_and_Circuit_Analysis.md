### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore the physics of motorcycle dynamics and develop [[Python]] code for analyzing motorcycle circuits, focusing on lean angles, speed calculations, and interpolation methods.

### Key Activities
- Reflected on the physics of motorcycle turns, emphasizing centripetal force and lean angles.
- Derived equations for net horizontal force and calculated lean angles using [[Python]] and scipy.
- Developed [[Python]] classes and functions for modeling motorcycle circuits, including speed scaling and time calculations.
- Implemented and corrected [[Python]] code for circuit metrics, including average speed, total time, and distance.
- Utilized interpolation methods (Cubic Spline and Akima1DInterpolator) for circuit data analysis.
- Addressed error handling in [[Python]] code, ensuring robustness in calculations.
- Visualized circuit speed profiles and time-distance relationships using [[Matplotlib]].

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and debugged [[Python]] code for calculating and visualizing motorcycle circuit dynamics.
- Improved interpolation techniques for more accurate data modeling.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of [[Python]] classes for more complex circuit modeling.
- Exploration of additional interpolation methods for enhanced accuracy in speed and distance calculations.
