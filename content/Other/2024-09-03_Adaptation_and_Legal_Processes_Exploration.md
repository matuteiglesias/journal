### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore various topics including the adaptation of air compressors for painting, materials for wall repair, scripting for product search, [[data analysis]] using [[Pandas]], and legal processes related to property acquisition in Argentina.

### Key Activities
1. **Adaptation of Air Compressors**: Discussed the feasibility and limitations of adapting a bicycle air compressor for painting, highlighting necessary components like capacity, spray guns, filters, and regulators.
2. **Wall Repair Materials**: Outlined essential and optional materials and tools for wall repair, providing budget [[optimization]] tips.
3. **Scripting for Product Search**: Developed a [[Python]] script template for searching painting and construction items on Mercado Libre.
4. **[[Data Analysis]] with [[Pandas]]**: Implemented a custom function to calculate the first quartile (Q1) in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame, utilizing the `agg` function for data aggregation.
5. **Legal Processes for Property Acquisition**: Detailed guides on acquiring abandoned property in Argentina through legal means, including usucapi√≥n.

### Achievements
