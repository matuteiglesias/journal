## 📅 2023-02-28 — Session: Analyzed Treatment Effects and Statistical Methods

**🕒 05:40–06:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Linear Regression, Treatment Effect, Python, Statistical Modeling  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore statistical methods for analyzing treatment effects, focusing on linear regression, treatment effects, confounding factors, and relevant software tools.

### Key Activities
- Discussed linear regression and treatment effects, including confounding factors and matching procedures.
- Detailed the mathematical expression for calculating the Adjusted Treatment Effect (ATE) using covariates.
- Outlined steps to calculate the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) using [[Python]]'s StandardScaler and NumPy.
- Provided mathematical formulas for variance and SMD, including [[Python]] code snippets.
- Explained methods for calculating the difference in means between treatment and control groups using [[Pandas]].

### Achievements
- Clarified the use of linear regression and treatment effects in statistical modeling.
- Developed a clear understanding of calculating ATE and SMD with [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of alternative methods for calculating mean differences in [[Pandas]].
- Review and application of discussed software tools for data analysis.
