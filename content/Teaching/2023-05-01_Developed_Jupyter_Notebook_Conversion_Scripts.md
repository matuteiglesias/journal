### Session Goal:
The session aimed to develop and refine scripts for converting [[Python]] scripts into [[Jupyter]] Notebook format, focusing on proper cell separation and formatting.

### Key Activities:
- Reviewed and outlined practical exercises for audio and video processing using [[Python]] libraries like librosa and OpenCV.
- Developed step-by-step guides and templates for processing multimedia data.
- Created and refined [[Python]] scripts to convert text files into [[Jupyter]] Notebook format, using regular expressions to separate markdown and code cells.
- Implemented solutions for common issues such as removing extra `#` symbols in markdown cells.

### Achievements:
- Successfully developed a comprehensive guide and scripts for converting [[Python]] scripts into [[Jupyter]] Notebooks.
- Addressed and solved issues related to cell formatting and separation, ensuring smooth conversion and proper notebook structure.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing of the conversion scripts with diverse and complex [[Python]] scripts to ensure robustness and flexibility.
