## 📅 2023-05-02 — Session: Developed exercises for unstructured data processing in Python

**🕒 20:25–20:35**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Data Processing, Unstructured Data, Exercises, Machine Learning  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop and outline exercises for processing unstructured data using [[Python]], focusing on both text and image data.

**Key Activities:**
- Reviewed fundamental data processing techniques, including data manipulation, aggregation, visualization, and storage using SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Developed exercises for loading and processing unstructured data types, such as text files, images, and audio files, using [[Python]] libraries like Pillow, Librosa, and requests.
- Designed practical exercises for text processing and analysis using spaCy, NLTK, and TextBlob, covering tokenization and sentiment analysis.
- Implemented image processing exercises using OpenCV, including feature extraction and classification using convolutional neural networks with TensorFlow.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created a comprehensive set of exercises for students to practice unstructured data handling and processing in [[Python]].

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refinement of exercises to include more advanced machine learning techniques for image and text data.
