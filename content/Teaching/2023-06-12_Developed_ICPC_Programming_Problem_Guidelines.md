### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop guidelines and problem simulations for the Latin American ICPC 2023 and explore [[AI]] applications in education.

### Key Activities
1. **ICPC Problem Submission Guidelines:** Reviewed and outlined the requirements for submitting problems for the Latin American ICPC 2023.
2. **Daily Trips Simulation:** Created a simulation problem involving decision-making based on weather reports and umbrella availability.
3. **[[Python]] Implementation:** Developed a [[Python]] solution to simulate the 'Daily Trips' problem.
4. **Challenge Compilation Proposal:** Proposed a framework for compiling programming challenges to enhance problem-solving skills using [[AI]] tools.
5. **[[AI]] in [[Education]] Reflection:** Explored the impact of [[AI]] in professional domains and education, focusing on collaboration and personalized feedback.
6. **Open Meeting Planning:** Planned steps to organize an open meeting for brainstorming challenge ideas.

### Achievements
- Established clear guidelines for ICPC 2023 problem submissions.
- Successfully simulated and implemented the 'Daily Trips' problem in [[Python]].
- Developed a proposal for a programming challenge compilation.
- Reflected on [[AI]]'s role in education and professional development.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the programming challenge compilation framework.
