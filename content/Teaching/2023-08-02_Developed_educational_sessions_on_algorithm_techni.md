**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop comprehensive educational materials and plans for teaching algorithm techniques, focusing on dynamic programming, backtracking, and greedy algorithms.

**Key Activities:**
- Formulated a recursive problem-solving framework for matrix selection.
- Provided an overview of algorithm exercises, including dynamic programming, backtracking, and greedy algorithms.
- Summarized key concepts and practical applications of algorithm techniques.
- Mapped exercises to algorithm concepts to enhance learning experiences.
- Planned detailed educational sessions, including exercises and discussions, for dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
- Developed specific exercises such as 'Terreno', 'Cajas', 'Vector de N√∫meros', and 'Parejas de Baile'.
- Compared greedy algorithms with dynamic programming and backtracking.

**Achievements:**
- Created structured plans for multiple educational sessions on algorithm techniques.
- Developed a variety of exercises to reinforce learning.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Implement the planned educational sessions and gather feedback for further improvement.
