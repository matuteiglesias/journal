### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and implement a greedy algorithm to solve the 'Parejas de Baile' problem, focusing on pairing dancers based on skill levels and other constraints.

### Key Activities
- Provided a detailed explanation of the 'Parejas de Baile' problem, including matching rules and guidance for educational activities.
- Created visual representations and diagrams to illustrate the problem and algorithmic flow.
- Expanded on the greedy strategy, including pseudocode and implementation guidelines.
- Conducted a programming session to implement the greedy solution, emphasizing collaboration and active participation.
- Analyzed the pairing logic in set theory, critiquing previous approaches and suggesting improvements.
- Demonstrated the correctness of the algorithm using loop invariants and inductive reasoning.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a comprehensive guide and visual aids for understanding and implementing the greedy algorithm for the 'Parejas de Baile' problem.
- Clarified the algorithm's correctness through formal demonstrations and theoretical analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of alternative algorithms that optimize pairing beyond the greedy approach.
- Consideration of additional constraints and attributes in the pairing process.
