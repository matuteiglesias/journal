### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and develop greedy algorithms for educational purposes, particularly focusing on optimizing student grouping and exam scheduling during a pandemic.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the application of greedy algorithms in pandemic education scenarios, focusing on student grouping while maintaining social distancing.
- Explored various greedy strategies across different problem domains such as task assignment, investment projects, and public transport planning.
- Developed a mathematical and computational approach to partition students into groups, ensuring proximity constraints.
- Conducted a class on university exam scheduling using greedy algorithms, including implementation and group discussion.
- Implemented and analyzed a greedy algorithm for exam organization, addressing scheduling conflicts and proposing exercises for further exploration.
- Provided guides for implementing greedy solutions in [[Python]] and C++, including detailed explanations of the `partition_students` function.
- Compared greedy algorithms with other paradigms like divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming, analyzing their complexity and efficiency.
- Explored real-world applications of greedy algorithms in industries such as finance and logistics.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed and documented several greedy algorithm implementations for educational settings.
- Enhanced understanding of greedy algorithms through practical coding sessions and theoretical discussions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of hybrid design strategies for greedy algorithms and their real-world applications.
- Additional classroom activities to deepen understanding of advanced greedy algorithm concepts.
