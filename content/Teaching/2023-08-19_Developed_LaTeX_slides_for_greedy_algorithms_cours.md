## 📅 2023-08-19 — Session: Developed LaTeX slides for greedy algorithms course

**🕒 17:05–18:25**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Latex, Greedy Algorithms, Presentation, Education, Computer Science  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to develop LaTeX slides for a course on greedy algorithms, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

**Key Activities:**
- Created structured LaTeX code for slides covering the definition and principles of greedy algorithms.
- Developed slides on 'Locally Optimal Choices' and their implications in greedy strategies.
- Included examples and use cases such as activity selection, fractional knapsack, and Huffman coding.
- Discussed the applicability of greedy algorithms, including key properties like the greedy choice property and optimal substructure.
- Prepared slides on the limitations of greedy strategies in optimization problems, particularly those that are NP-complete.
- Compared greedy algorithms with dynamic programming and backtracking techniques.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully created a comprehensive set of LaTeX slides for teaching greedy algorithms, covering theoretical insights, practical examples, and limitations.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further refinement of slides to include more detailed examples and exercises for advanced understanding.
- Plan and prepare additional materials for the upcoming class session.
