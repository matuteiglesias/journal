### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to analyze interests in practical [[AI]] applications and develop a structured proposal for an introductory talk and course on Artificial Intelligence.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed responses about interests in practical [[AI]] applications, categorizing them into three groups: Interface and Consultation, [[Automation]] and Efficiency, and Exploration and Curiosity.
- Proposed a structure for an introductory talk addressing these themes, including topics like the history of [[AI]], interaction with tools like ChatGPT, and automation processes.
- Developed an outline for an introductory [[AI]] course, covering key topics such as history, tools, machine learning, neural networks, and ethical considerations.
- Created a LaTeX Beamer presentation structure for [[AI]] topics, including sections on history, tools, and automation.
- Provided a detailed script for presentation slides on [[AI]] topics, including [[Machine Learning]], [[NLP]], Computer Vision, and Recommender Systems.

### Achievements
- Successfully developed a structured proposal for an introductory talk on [[AI]], incorporating workshop dynamics and practical applications.
- Completed an outline for an introductory [[AI]] course, detailing essential topics and ethical considerations.
- Created a basic LaTeX code for structuring presentations in Beamer, focused on [[AI]].

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the detailed script for the [[AI]] presentation slides.
- Review and refine the LaTeX presentation structure for clarity and completeness.
