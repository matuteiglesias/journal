## 📅 2023-10-09 — Session: Evaluated student responses on graph theory algorithms

**🕒 16:40–20:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: DFS, Graph Theory, Student Evaluation, Algorithms  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to evaluate student responses related to graph theory algorithms, specifically focusing on the use of Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify bridges in graphs and understand connectivity issues.

**Key Activities:**
- Conducted detailed analysis of student responses (No143, No98, No13, No193) regarding the use of DFS for identifying bridges in graphs.
- Provided feedback on students' understanding and areas for improvement, highlighting correct approaches and misunderstandings.
- Discussed algorithmic proposals for identifying connections between friends using DFS and the complexity involved.
- Implemented and reviewed pseudocode for detecting and removing bridges in graphs, ensuring clarity in the algorithm's steps and complexity.
- Outlined algorithms to determine distinct paths between friends and detect isolated friends in a graph using back-edges.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully evaluated multiple student responses, providing constructive feedback and identifying key areas for improvement.
- Developed and reviewed pseudocode for bridge detection and removal, enhancing understanding of graph connectivity.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further review and refinement of algorithms to ensure efficient identification of bridges and connected components in graphs.
