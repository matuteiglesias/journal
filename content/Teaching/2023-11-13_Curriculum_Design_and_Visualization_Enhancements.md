**üïí 19:30‚Äì20:20**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Curriculum, Education, Visualization, Python, Graphviz  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session focused on refining the curriculum design for a computer science program and enhancing data visualization techniques for educational planning.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the placement and prerequisites for 'Introducci√≥n a las Bases de Datos' and 'Aprendizaje Autom√°tico' within the curriculum to ensure logical sequencing and foundational knowledge.
- Justified the removal of 'Advanced Analysis' and 'Introduction to Natural Sciences Elective' from the [[Data Science]] Bachelor's program, emphasizing course relevance and applicability.
- Outlined implementation steps for an unspecified process, likely related to curriculum changes or visualization enhancements.
- Developed a strategy for color-coding nodes in graph visualizations by semester using [[Python]] and [[Matplotlib]], enhancing clarity and understanding of course sequencing.
- Provided a method for converting RGBA colors to hexadecimal for Graphviz integration, facilitating better visualization compatibility.

### Achievements
- Clarified curriculum adjustments and their justifications, aligning courses with educational goals.
- Enhanced visualization techniques for curriculum mapping, improving the clarity of educational planning tools.

### Pending Tasks
- Further implementation of the outlined process steps and verification of the visualization enhancements in a practical setting.
