## 📅 2023-11-15 — Session: Structured Feedback and Solution Development for Algorithms

**🕒 21:40–22:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: feedback, algorithms, C++, programming, education  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to provide structured feedback on algorithmic solutions and develop minimal solutions for programming exercises.

### Key Activities
- Constructed a feedback framework for algorithm solutions, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions.
- Developed guides and templates for solving programming exercises involving recursion and [[optimization]].
- Provided feedback on multiple C++ programming solutions, highlighting [[documentation]] and [[optimization]] strategies.
- Outlined minimal solutions for exercises such as 'Board and Piece Problem' and 'Pending Corrections', emphasizing best practices and modularity.

### Achievements
- Successfully created a structured feedback framework for algorithmic solutions.
- Developed minimal solution outlines for several programming exercises, including code snippets and best practice strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of feedback frameworks for broader application.
- Implementation of solution outlines in real-world scenarios to test efficacy.
