### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and clarify various graph theory algorithms and educational evaluation methods, focusing on Johnson's algorithm, verification of shortest paths, and computational complexity evaluation.

### Key Activities
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Discussed Johnson's algorithm, which combines Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra, for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs. Explored the educational implications and verification methods for shortest paths using algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and BFS.
- **Educational Evaluation**: Reviewed student responses in computational complexity, identifying issues in understanding and justification. Provided feedback on distinguishing between 'clique' and 'dominant set' in graph theory.
- **Student Guidance**: Analyzed student NO 106's response on NP-hardness, emphasizing the need for clear justification in graph transformations and polynomial time reductions.

### Achievements
- Clarified the application and verification of graph algorithms in educational contexts.
- Provided detailed feedback on student evaluations and responses, improving understanding of computational complexity.
- Enhanced student guidance on graph theory concepts, particularly in distinguishing between cliques and dominant sets.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of student misconceptions in computational complexity and graph theory to refine educational strategies.
