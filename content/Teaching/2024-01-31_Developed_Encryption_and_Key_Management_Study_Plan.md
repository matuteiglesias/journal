**Session Goal:**
The primary goal of this session was to develop a comprehensive study plan focused on encryption methods and key management within [[Google Cloud]] Platform (GCP), as well as to reflect on various encryption techniques and their applications.

**Key Activities:**
- Created a structured study plan for learning about encryption methods in GCP, including objectives, time allocations, and recommended resources.
- Reflected on asymmetric encryption, detailing its processes, use-cases, and algorithms such as RSA and ECC.
- Explored cloud storage encryption in GCP, focusing on Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) and Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK).
- Reviewed encryption mechanisms in GCP's database services, including Cloud SQL and BigQuery.
- Outlined a key management methodology for sensitive environments, emphasizing security and compliance.

**Achievements:**
- Developed a detailed plan for studying encryption methods and key management in GCP.
- Gained insights into asymmetric encryption and its importance in secure communications.
- Clarified the types of encryption keys available in GCP and their benefits.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Further exploration of encryption tools and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
- Implementation of the study plan and evaluation of learning outcomes.
