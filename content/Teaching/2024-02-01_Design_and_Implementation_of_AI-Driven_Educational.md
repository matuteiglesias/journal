### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to explore and design [[AI]]-driven tools for enhancing educational practices, focusing on evaluation, feedback, and data management.

### Key Activities
- Proposed reflective questions to assess understanding of algorithm concepts, encouraging critical thinking and practical application.
- Developed guidelines for organizing effective practice sessions, including planning, execution, and feedback.
- Suggested a system for practice and evaluation using Google tools, covering student registration, form design, response collection, and feedback.
- Planned a workflow using [[Google Cloud]] Platform for secure and scalable student response management.
- Detailed a structured approach for data collection and storage using Google Forms and [[Google Cloud]] SQL.
- Explored [[AI]] models for automated grading, discussing specific training and hybrid systems.
- Described the process of customizing GPT models for specific tasks like grading.
- Proposed a database schema for storing and processing student responses.
- Explored using [[AI]] for instant feedback in education, detailing implementation steps.
- Outlined the development of an integrated educational platform using GCP and GPT.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for using [[AI]] and cloud technologies in education.
- Created detailed plans for implementing [[AI]]-driven feedback and evaluation systems.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed [[AI]] grading models and evaluate their effectiveness.
- Develop and test the integrated educational platform with GCP and GPT.
