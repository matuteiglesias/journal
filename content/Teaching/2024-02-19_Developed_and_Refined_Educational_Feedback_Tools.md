### Session Goal:
The session aimed to refine tools for providing constructive feedback in computer science education and to address OAuth configuration issues in a [[Flask]] application.

### Key Activities:
- Refined a [[Python]] function for constructing prompts that evaluate student responses, focusing on high academic standards and constructive feedback.
- Simulated a student response for an algorithm task, providing insights into complexity analysis and areas for improvement.
- Analyzed effective feedback strategies in computer science education, emphasizing the balance of reinforcement and actionable recommendations.
- Developed a [[Python]] function to integrate examples and resources into feedback prompts.
- Outlined steps to troubleshoot and configure OAuth settings in a [[Flask]] app, including setting up consent screens and authorized domains.
- Created templates for privacy policy and terms of service documents in LaTeX and Markdown, ensuring legal compliance.

### Achievements:
- Successfully refined educational tools for feedback in computer science, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of student evaluations.
- Provided comprehensive guidance on OAuth configuration and verification for Google APIs.

### Pending Tasks:
- Further testing and refinement of the feedback tools in a real educational setting.
- Complete the OAuth verification process with Google for the [[Flask]] application.
