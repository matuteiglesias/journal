**Session Goal:**
The session aimed to develop a comprehensive curriculum for teaching Unit 4, focusing on greedy algorithms and graph concepts. The goal was to create a structured outline that progresses from basic to advanced topics, integrating optional challenges to cater to different student readiness levels.

**Key Activities:**
- Proposed a framework for organizing Unit 4, integrating greedy algorithms and graph concepts with a gradual increase in difficulty.
- Developed a structured outline for teaching, including optional sections and complex exercises.
- Created a practice structure for greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, focusing on graph applications.
- Organized a course on graph theory, covering graph properties, algorithms, integrative exercises, and practical applications.
- Revised a LaTeX document to improve clarity and structure related to graphs and algorithms.
- Thematically organized graph theory exercises for better coherence and progression.
- Proposed a title for a unit focused on advanced graph challenges, algorithm design, and modeling problems.
- Explored advanced strategies in graph algorithms and [[optimization]], including innovative solutions and practical applications.
- Developed a guide on advanced algorithms and data structures, focusing on [[optimization]] techniques in graphs and digraphs, and the application of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

**Achievements:**
- Completed a comprehensive curriculum framework for Unit 4, integrating greedy algorithms and graph concepts.
- Enhanced the LaTeX document structure for better presentation of graph theory content.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Finalize the curriculum by incorporating feedback from peers and testing the exercises with a pilot group.
- Further refine the LaTeX document based on additional insights or feedback.
