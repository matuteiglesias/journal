### Session Goal
The session aimed to organize and analyze exercises for an advanced computer science course, focusing on categorizing them by units and weeks, and aligning them with the course curriculum.

### Key Activities
- **Assistance Offer:** The assistant expressed readiness to help with any challenges, inviting specification of needs.
- **Exercise Grouping:** Requested a list of exercises to categorize by units and weeks for an advanced computer science course.
- **Bash Scripting:** Provided a Bash command using `awk` for extracting every nth line from a `.tex` file, including filename at the top of the output file.
- **AWK Command Correction:** Clarified the use of the `-v` option in `awk` for variable definition to skip every 10 lines in a file.
- **Curriculum Mapping:** Categorized exercises from 'practica_1_tecnicas_algoritmicas.tex' according to specific units focusing on iterative search techniques, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
- **Reorganization [[Strategy]]:** Proposed a strategy for reorganizing graph and algorithm exercises, distributing them by units and classifying by complexity and educational focus.
- **Graph Exercise Analysis:** Detailed assignment of graph exercises to units, considering dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
- **Content Analysis:** Analyzed exercise placement in specific course units, suggesting Practice 5 on shortest paths for unit 5 and client assignment problems for unit 6.
- **Thematic Assignment Proposal:** Suggested thematic distribution of graph and algorithm exercises, considering learning objectives and thematic relevance.

### Achievements
- Successfully mapped and categorized exercises to specific units of the computer science course.
- Provided practical solutions for text extraction tasks using Bash scripting.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of exercise categorization to ensure alignment with course objectives.
- Verification of exercise difficulty levels and educational focus for optimal student engagement.
