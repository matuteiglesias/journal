**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


**Session Goal:**
The goal of this session was to develop and refine the content for a course on algorithmic techniques, specifically focusing on backtracking and optimization strategies.

**Key Activities:**
- Structured a course outline covering various algorithmic techniques including brute force, backtracking, and optimization.
- Detailed advanced backtracking techniques and their application in algorithm design, focusing on complexity analysis and problem-solving.
- Proposed essential lines for slides on algorithmic techniques, emphasizing brute force and backtracking.
- Created a script for a 10-minute session introducing algorithmic techniques in the context of Algorithms and Data Structures III.
- Developed a lesson script on brute force and backtracking, highlighting their applications and complexities.
- Illustrated practical applications of backtracking, such as the CD optimization problem and the Problem of Dobra, emphasizing pruning and recursion.

**Achievements:**
- Completed the course outline and scripts for teaching algorithmic techniques.
- Provided practical examples and case studies to enhance understanding of backtracking.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Finalize the presentation slides based on the proposed lines.
- Review and refine the lesson scripts for clarity and engagement.
