**üïí 18:55‚Äì21:45**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Algorithms, Education, Curriculum, Student Support  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and update academic content and protocols for a course on Algorithms and Data Structures, focusing on both curriculum design and student assessment methods.

### Key Activities
- **Curriculum Development**: Designed a structured academic program divided into six units, covering fundamental to advanced topics in algorithms and data structures, including practical exercises for each unit.
- **Approval Framework Update**: Proposed a new framework for course approval and promotion, detailing requirements for practical exercises, final exams, and direct promotion criteria.
- **Algorithm Exercise Design**: Created the 'Parejas de Baile' exercise, which involves forming pairs using greedy algorithms to maximize pairings based on dance skills.
- **Algorithm Description**: Detailed a greedy algorithm for pairing dancers from two groups, aiming to maximize the number of pairs with similar skills.
- **Student Consultation Protocol**: Revised the protocol for student consultations to improve learning and problem-solving through structured feedback and preparation.

### Achievements
- Successfully structured a comprehensive academic program and updated the approval framework.
- Developed a practical exercise and algorithm description for educational use.
- Enhanced student consultation protocols to better support learning.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the academic program and approval framework based on feedback from stakeholders.
- Implementation and testing of the 'Parejas de Baile' exercise in a classroom setting.
