### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the algorithm curriculum by organizing exercises thematically, identifying gaps, and designing comprehensive exam questions.

### Key Activities
- Thematic grouping of algorithm exercises into categories such as Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal, and Divide and Conquer.
- Identification of blind spots in the current curriculum and suggestions for new exercises.
- Creation of multiple-choice questions on Greedy and String Algorithms.
- [[Development]] of exam questions for Algorithm Design and Graph Theory.
- Structuring exams focusing on DFS and BFS techniques.
- Designing standardized test questions and exercises for DFS and BFS.
- Proposal for a new exam schema covering Graph Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, and Algorithmic Techniques.

### Achievements
- Comprehensive list of exam questions and exercises created for various algorithmic topics.
- Structured exam plans and templates developed for DFS, BFS, and Divide and Conquer techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Implementation and testing of the new curriculum and exam designs in educational settings.
- Further refinement of exercises and questions based on student feedback.
