### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and implement a topological sorting algorithm to address dependency issues in computer systems and to develop criteria for evaluating student exams on algorithms.

### Key Activities
- Designed an algorithm for topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm to solve dependency problems in computer systems.
- Developed specific performance criteria for evaluating student responses in algorithm exams, focusing on demonstration, explanation, and coding.
- Evaluated student responses on algorithm and graph topics, highlighting areas of understanding and deficiencies.
- Conducted detailed analysis of student responses, assessing comprehension, correctness, clarity, and use of concepts.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed and presented a topological sorting algorithm with implementation in pseudocode.
- Established a framework for evaluating algorithm exams with a detailed scoring system.
- Completed evaluations of multiple student responses, providing insights into their understanding and areas for improvement.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refine the evaluation criteria based on feedback from student assessments.
- Implement the topological sorting algorithm in a programming language for practical application.
