**🕒 17:10–20:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: dynamic programming, education, student evaluation, algorithm analysis  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to plan and execute a series of tasks related to dynamic programming and [[education]] management.

### Key Activities
- Developed a structured guide for an effective afternoon, including time blocks for various tasks.
- Outlined a detailed afternoon work plan focusing on exam corrections and course management.
- Planned and executed a dynamic programming solution for a problem involving the distribution of alfajores, including defining recursive functions and implementing algorithms.
- Analyzed and corrected errors in a student's solution to an [[optimization]] problem, providing insights and corrections.
- Evaluated a student's approach to recursion, identifying logical errors and suggesting improvements.
- Conducted a detailed evaluation of a student's responses in an educational context, focusing on algorithm design and mathematical correctness.
- Planned a weekly schedule for Teaching Assistants at UBA, covering administrative and academic tasks.

### Achievements
- Created a comprehensive plan for the afternoon, balancing work and breaks.
- Successfully implemented and optimized a dynamic programming solution.
- Provided valuable feedback and corrections to students' work, enhancing their understanding.
- Developed a structured weekly plan for Teaching Assistants.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the dynamic programming algorithm based on student feedback.
- Continued evaluation of student responses to ensure understanding and improvement.
