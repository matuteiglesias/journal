**üïí 00:20‚Äì03:00**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: education, data engineering, machine learning, Google Cloud Platform, student evaluation, course development  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to critically evaluate student responses on graph cycles, prepare for an Algorithms 3 meeting, and plan educational resources and strategies for [[data processing]] and [[machine learning]].

### Key Activities
1. **Student Evaluation**: Conducted a critical analysis of student responses on detecting cycles in directed graphs, focusing on clarity and precision.
2. **Meeting Preparation**: Drafted a memo for an upcoming Algorithms 3 meeting, outlining agenda, action items, and objectives for teaching assistants.
3. **Exam Preparation**: Prepared for an exam on [[data processing]] systems and [[machine learning]] solutions, covering design, ingestion, storage, analysis, and [[automation]].
4. **Textbook Development**: Initiated the design of a comprehensive textbook for data and [[machine learning]] engineering, including an overview of 'Mastering Data Engineering and [[Machine Learning]] on [[Google Cloud]] Platform'.
5. **Course Outline**: Developed a course outline for a graduate-level course on data engineering and [[machine learning]], detailing objectives and syllabus.
6. **Data Management Planning**: Outlined strategies for data ingestion, processing, storage, and management on [[Google Cloud]] Platform, including data pipelines, storage solutions, and visualization techniques.
7. **ML Solutions Architecture**: Planned the architecture of ML solutions, focusing on model training, scaling, and monitoring on [[Google Cloud]] Platform.

### Achievements
- Completed a detailed analysis of student responses and prepared a structured memo for the Algorithms 3 meeting.
- Advanced the planning of educational materials, including textbooks and course outlines.
- Developed comprehensive guides for data management and ML solution architecture.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the textbook content and course materials.
- Implement the planned strategies for data management and ML solutions.
- Conduct the Algorithms 3 meeting and apply insights from the memo.
