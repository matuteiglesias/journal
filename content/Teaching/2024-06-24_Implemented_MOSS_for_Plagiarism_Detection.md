### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to set up and implement the Measure Of Software Similarity (MOSS) tool for detecting plagiarism in student programming submissions.

### Key Activities
- Set up MOSS for plagiarism detection, including registration and installation.
- Developed a [[Python]] script to integrate MOSS, organizing submissions and automating the process using the subprocess module.
- Modified the script to handle file limitations and tested the functionality.
- Resolved an error in the MOSS script by removing the unrecognized '-u' option.
- Executed the MOSS script and summarized the results, indicating no plagiarism detected.
- Explained the structure and functionality of the MOSS Perl script for plagiarism checks.
- Managed submission limits by batching files and automating the process with a [[Python]] script.
- Automated batch submission of [[Python]] files for similarity checks.
- Used shell commands to count files by extension within a directory.
- Identified issues with file processing and suggested improvements for error reporting.

### Achievements
- Successfully set up and executed MOSS for plagiarism detection with no plagiarism detected in the test submissions.
- Improved the MOSS script for better file handling and error management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of the MOSS execution results to refine the process and ensure robustness.
- Implement additional [[error handling]] and reporting mechanisms as suggested.
