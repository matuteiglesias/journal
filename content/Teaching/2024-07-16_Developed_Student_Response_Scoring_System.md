### Session Goal
The aim of this session was to develop a comprehensive system for scoring student responses using both [[Python]] and Google Sheets.

### Key Activities
1. **Algorithm Development**: Created an algorithm to calculate student scores based on the numeric difference between student responses and correct answers. This included pseudocode and a [[Python]] implementation.
2. **Google Sheets Implementation**: Developed a grading system in Google Sheets, which involved:
   - Converting answers to numeric values.
   - Calculating sums for correct and student answers.
   - Determining differences and assigning scores based on these differences.
   - Utilizing formulas like VLOOKUP and ARRAYFORMULA to handle multiple-choice answers and calculate absolute differences.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented the scoring algorithm in [[Python]].
- Created a functional grading system in Google Sheets with detailed formulas and steps.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and validation of the Google Sheets formulas to ensure accuracy.
- [[Integration]] of the [[Python]] algorithm with existing educational platforms for automated scoring.
