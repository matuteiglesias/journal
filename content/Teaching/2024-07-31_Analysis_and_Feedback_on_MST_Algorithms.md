### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze and provide feedback on students' understanding and solutions related to Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) using various algorithms, including Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed a student's reasoning process for determining a unique MST in graphs, focusing on complexity issues and optimization suggestions.
- Provided feedback on students' understanding of MST concepts and proposed an algorithm for determining MST uniqueness based on edge weights.
- Evaluated and improved a student's solution using Prim's algorithm for MST, recommending enhancements for clarity and efficiency.
- Assessed a student's solution using Kruskal's algorithm with a focus on tie detection and efficient verification methods.
- Compared student proposals using Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms for optimal location determination.

### Achievements
- Identified key areas of improvement in students' understanding and implementation of MST algorithms.
- Proposed optimized algorithms and methods for verifying MST uniqueness and complexity.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of student solutions based on feedback and evaluations provided.
- Continued monitoring of students' progress in understanding and applying graph algorithms.
