**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and integrate educational tools and resources for computational linear algebra courses, focusing on repository structuring, workbook integration, and pedagogical analysis.

### Key Activities
- **LU and QR Factorization Exercises**: Implemented practical exercises in [[Python]] to solve linear systems and compare the efficiency of LU and QR factorizations.
- **Course [[Integration]] Planning**: Outlined strategies for integrating computational linear algebra workbooks into courses using [[Jupyter]] Notebooks for collaborative learning.
- **Repository Structure Design**: Proposed a detailed repository structure for linear algebra courses, facilitating documentation, exercises, and notebook organization.
- **OpenAI [[API]] [[Integration]]**: Developed [[Python]] classes `EvaluatorClean` and `EvaluatorDeep` to clean exercise statements and provide pedagogical evaluations using the OpenAI [[API]].
- **Notebook Creation [[Automation]]**: Implemented the `NotebookCreator` class to automate the creation of [[Jupyter]] notebooks from markdown files, ensuring proper formatting and metadata.

### Achievements
- Successfully designed a comprehensive repository structure for educational courses.
- Enhanced the evaluation of educational exercises using [[AI]]-driven tools.
- Developed scripts to automate notebook creation, improving efficiency in course material preparation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the `NotebookCreator` class to ensure compatibility across different platforms.
- [[Integration]] of additional educational resources and exercises into the repository.
