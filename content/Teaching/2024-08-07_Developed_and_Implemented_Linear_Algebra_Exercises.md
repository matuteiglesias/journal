## 📅 2024-08-07 — Session: Developed and Implemented Linear Algebra Exercises

**🕒 15:30–18:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: linear algebra, Python, education, exercise development, file management  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to develop and implement exercises related to linear algebra, focusing on generator systems, linear independence, linear transformations, and subspaces, with practical [[Python]] applications.

### Key Activities
- Conducted a class on generator systems and linear transformations, including [[Python]] implementations.
- Developed a laboratory session focusing on problem-solving in linear algebra, covering linear independence and transformations.
- Created computational exercises in [[Python]] to calculate matrix rank, determine bases, and verify dimensional properties using methods like Gaussian elimination and SVD.
- Analyzed and recommended improvements for the sequence of exercises in linear algebra classes.
- Developed and debugged a [[Python]] script to split exercises from a markdown file into separate files for better organization and management.

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented and tested exercises in [[Python]], enhancing the educational material for linear algebra.
- Improved the sequence and structure of exercises, providing a more coherent learning path.
- Developed a robust script for managing markdown files containing exercises.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of exercise sequences based on feedback from educational sessions.
- Continuous improvement and testing of the [[Python]] script to ensure reliability in diverse scenarios.
