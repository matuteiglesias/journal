### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop educational resources for teaching linear algebra, focusing on norms in vector spaces, condition number sensitivity, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Key Activities
- Created a detailed guide for structuring a repository of [[Jupyter]] notebooks to support linear algebra teaching.
- Developed a notebook plan covering norms in vector spaces, including definitions, properties, and exercises.
- Conducted a pedagogical analysis of linear algebra teaching strategies, identifying areas for improvement and making recommendations.
- Outlined learning objectives and curriculum for norms in vector spaces.
- Explored condition number sensitivity analysis and regularization techniques.
- Sought examples of ill-conditioned matrices for data science applications.
- Reflected on operator norms and singular values in matrix analysis.
- Executed [[Python]] scripts for SVD and visualizations, improving code clarity and accessibility.
- Translated and enhanced the spectral theorem explanation and related code.
- Developed improved [[Python]] code for image reconstruction using SVD.
- Provided insights on KDE and low-rank approximation in SVD.
- Planned a repository structure for computational linear algebra courses.

### Achievements
- Established a comprehensive framework for teaching linear algebra concepts using [[Python]] and SVD.
- Improved educational materials and resources for better pedagogical outcomes.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the repository structure and educational content.
- Implementation of recommendations from the pedagogical analysis.
