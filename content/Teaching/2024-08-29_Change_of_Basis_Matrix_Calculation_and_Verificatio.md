### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore and implement the change of basis matrix calculations between different vector spaces, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using [[Python]].

### Key Activities
- **Change of Basis Matrix Calculation and Error Analysis**: Explored the process of calculating the change of basis matrix from one basis to another, identifying potential errors in the transformation process.
- **[[Python]] Implementation**: Developed [[Python]] code to compute the change of basis matrix, including debugging and verification steps.
- **Inconsistency Diagnosis**: Analyzed and diagnosed inconsistencies in vector transformations, detailing computations and potential error sources.
- **Verification**: Implemented a [[Python]] script to verify change of basis transformations using NumPy, ensuring accurate vector transformations between bases.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Utilized NumPy and SymPy for streamlined change of basis calculations, providing example code for efficient implementation.

### Achievements
- Successfully calculated and verified change of basis matrices using both manual and [[Python]]-based methods.
- Identified and addressed potential errors in the transformation process, improving accuracy and reliability.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of advanced matrix operations and optimizations using [[Python]] libraries.
- Implementation of additional test cases to ensure robustness of the change of basis calculations.
