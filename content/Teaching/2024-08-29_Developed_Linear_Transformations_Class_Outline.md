**🕒 17:15–17:40**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Linear Transformations, Python, Education, Matrix Operations, Teaching  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to create a comprehensive outline for a class on linear transformations, integrating practical coding exercises to enhance understanding.

### Key Activities
- Developed a detailed breakdown of a 3-hour class covering scaling, shearing, rotation, and affine transformations.
- Explained [[Python]] functions for 2D point transformations using matrices.
- Integrated coding activities into the class structure to reinforce learning.
- Outlined teaching strategies for matrix inversion, including practical applications.
- Resolved exercises on change of basis in \( B^3 \) and verified transformation accuracy.
- Addressed discrepancies in change of basis matrix applications with [[Python]] code.

### Achievements
- Completed a structured class outline with integrated coding exercises.
- Provided clear explanations and [[Python]] implementations for key concepts.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of teaching materials and exercises for clarity and engagement.
