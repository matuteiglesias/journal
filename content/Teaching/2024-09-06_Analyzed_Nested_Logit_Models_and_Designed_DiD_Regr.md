**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to deepen understanding of Nested Logit Models in transportation and to design a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression problem for educational purposes.

### Key Activities
- Reviewed essential topics and textbooks for mastering nested logit models, focusing on transportation decision-making.
- Designed a step-by-step approach for a DiD regression setup, including sample data and estimation questions.
- Presented DiD estimates with intentional errors to challenge students in identifying mistakes.
- Developed strategies to introduce realistic errors in DiD calculations.
- Analyzed investment options using EUT and CPT, concluding Asset B as preferred.
- Provided feedback on dynamic decision-making problems and game theory questions, suggesting improvements for clarity.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into nested logit models and their application in transportation.
- Created educational content for DiD regression problem, enhancing learning through error analysis.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of feedback on dynamic decision-making and game theory problems for clarity and depth.
