**🕒 15:35–16:20**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Econometrics, Nested Logit, Education, Graduate Questions, Transportation  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop a series of advanced econometric questions suitable for graduate and post-graduate students, focusing on binary outcome models and nested logit models.

### Key Activities
- Generated question ideas for econometric analysis, particularly binary models like probit and logit.
- Outlined advanced questions for PhD students, including likelihood ratio tests.
- Developed questions requiring deep understanding of econometric models, endogeneity, and maximum likelihood estimation.
- Summarized and corrected Nested Logit Model results and analyses, focusing on transportation choices and cross-price elasticity.

### Achievements
- Created a comprehensive set of challenging econometric questions for educational purposes.
- Enhanced the understanding of nested logit models and their application in transportation economics.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement and testing of the developed questions with target student groups.
