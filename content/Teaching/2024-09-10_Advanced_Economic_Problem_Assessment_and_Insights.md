### Session Goal
The session aimed to evaluate and generate advanced economic problems and insights suitable for PhD-level education, focusing on asset pricing, consumption habits, and game theory.

### Key Activities
- **Assessment of Advanced Economics Problem**: Evaluated the complexity of an asset-pricing problem for PhD students, focusing on consumption habits and risk aversion.
- **PhD-Level Questions in Consumption-Based Asset Pricing**: Outlined approaches to formulate challenging questions in consumption-based asset pricing, addressing model dynamics and empirical applications.
- **Weibull Distribution Analysis for Job Tenure**: Analyzed job tenure using a Weibull distribution model, considering factors like education, sector, and gender.
- **Equilibrium Bid Calculation for Buyer 1**: Derived the equilibrium bid strategy for a buyer in auction theory.
- **Challenging Abstract Economic Questions**: Developed complex questions in game theory, stochastic control, and auction design.
- **Modeling a Two-Period Bargaining Game**: Outlined a model for a two-period bargaining game with a [[Python]] simulation.
- **Guidelines for Using External Tools on Strict Platforms**: Provided best practices for using tools like Grammarly on strict platforms.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive set of PhD-level economic problems and insights.
- Enhanced understanding of complex economic models and strategies.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of empirical applications in consumption-based asset pricing.
- Detailed analysis and simulation of the two-period bargaining game.
