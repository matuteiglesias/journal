## 📅 2024-10-24 — Session: Class Preparation on Computational Linear Algebra: Power Method and PCA

**🕒 15:20–16:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Power Method, PCA, class preparation, computational linear algebra, teaching  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to prepare for a class on computational linear algebra, focusing on two main topics: the Power Method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Key Activities
- **Power Method Preparation**: Developed a detailed class plan for a 1.5-hour session on the Power Method, covering eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This included creating practical exercises and a [[Python]] implementation guide.
- **PCA Preparation**: Planned a 1.5-hour class on PCA, focusing on dimensionality reduction, eigenfaces, and classification. Prepared materials for practical examples and visualizations.

### Achievements
- Completed the class preparation for both the Power Method and PCA, ensuring that all necessary materials and guides are ready for teaching.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and refine the prepared materials to ensure clarity and effectiveness before the actual class session.
