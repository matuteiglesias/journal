### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to plan the day effectively and delve into mathematical concepts related to linear algebra and optimization.

### Key Activities
- Developed a comprehensive daily plan considering key appointments and optimizing available time for productivity.
- Revised the daily schedule to include project management, lab preparation, content planning, and personal activities.
- Proposed a structured class on computational linear algebra focusing on the least squares method, including its mathematical derivation and practical applications.
- Explored traditional and computational approaches to solving least squares problems, including partial derivatives and normal equations.
- Detailed the use of Cholesky decomposition for solving normal equations derived from least squares minimization.
- Analyzed advanced mathematical topics such as polynomial interpolation, QR factorization, and singular value decomposition (SVD).

### Achievements
- Successfully created a detailed daily schedule that balances professional and personal tasks.
- Developed a comprehensive framework for teaching least squares in a computational algebra context.
- Enhanced understanding of mathematical optimization techniques and their applications.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed class structure and conduct a trial session.
- Further explore the application of QR factorization and SVD in real-world problems.
