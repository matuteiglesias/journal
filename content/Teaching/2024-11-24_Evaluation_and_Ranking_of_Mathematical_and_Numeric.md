## 📅 2024-11-24 — Session: Evaluation and Ranking of Mathematical and Numerical Methods

**🕒 00:25–01:50**  
**🏷️ Labels**: evaluation, ranking, mathematics, numerical methods, education  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to handle a common [[Python]] error, prove a matrix geometric series, and evaluate various mathematical and numerical method implementations.

### Key Activities
- Addressed the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `google.colab`, providing alternatives for code execution outside Google Colaboratory.
- Provided a structured proof of the matrix geometric series sum for the inverse of (I - A), including common student errors and a grading rubric.
- Ranked and evaluated student responses on mathematical concepts, assessing strengths, weaknesses, and providing feedback.
- Evaluated and ranked implementations of the power method and Monte Carlo simulations based on clarity, correctness, efficiency, and other criteria.

### Achievements
- Successfully provided solutions for running code that relies on Google Colaboratory.
- Completed a detailed proof of the matrix geometric series sum.
- Delivered comprehensive evaluations and rankings for both mathematical responses and numerical method implementations.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of evaluation criteria for future assessments.
- Exploration of additional features in Monte Carlo simulations.
