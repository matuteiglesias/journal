### Session Goal
The session aimed to analyze the convergence and error of the power series for matrix inversion and evaluate group responses to specific tasks, focusing on code quality and analytical depth.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed the convergence and error of the power series for matrix inversion, including plotting the series, checking for convergence, establishing convergence rules, and computing the error.
- Evaluated group responses for Consigna 4, focusing on criteria such as code readability, visualization quality, analytical discussion, and completeness.
- Conducted detailed evaluations of group performances in code analysis, emphasizing code readability, visualization quality, discussion depth, and output completeness.
- Critically evaluated group submissions in spectral radius analysis, focusing on analytical depth and effectiveness in discussing the spectral radius condition.
- Summarized evaluations of group submissions for Consigna 5, assessing execution, clarity, results, visualizations, strengths, weaknesses, and overall ratings.

### Achievements
- Established convergence rules and computed errors for matrix inversion using power series.
- Ranked groups based on code quality and analytical depth, providing insights into strengths and weaknesses.

### Pending Tasks
- Further analysis of group responses to Consigna 5 is required to finalize evaluations.
