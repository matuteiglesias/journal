**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to create a mock exam with questions simulating the content of a linear algebra exam, focusing on diagonalization and matrix properties.

### Key Activities
- Proposed a mock exam template including conceptual and practical problems on diagonalization and matrix properties.
- Outlined potential student questions regarding matrix diagonalization, condition numbers, and matrix properties.
- Discussed the relationship between algebraic and geometric multiplicity of eigenvalues for matrix diagonalization.
- Presented key questions on diagonalization and orthogonal projection matrices for feedback.
- Explored questions about symmetric matrix diagonalization, infinite condition numbers, and the implications of eigenvalues on the stability of iterative systems.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive set of questions and templates for a mock exam in linear algebra.

### Pending Tasks
- Provide answers and examples for the outlined questions to aid in classroom preparation.
