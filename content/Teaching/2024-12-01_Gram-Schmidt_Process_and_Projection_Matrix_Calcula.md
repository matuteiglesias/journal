### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to execute and reflect on the Gram-Schmidt process and the subsequent calculation of projection matrices in linear algebra.

### Key Activities
- **Gram-Schmidt Process:** Applied the Gram-Schmidt process to initial vectors \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \), resulting in normalized orthonormal vectors.
- **Projection Matrix Calculation:** Constructed projection matrices using the orthonormal vectors \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \), allowing for orthogonal projection of vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).
- **Resolution of Linear Systems:** Discussed the resolution of linear systems using the projection matrix, analyzing conditions for solutions and their geometric interpretations.

### Achievements
- Successfully calculated and interpreted the orthonormal vectors and projection matrices.
- Developed a deeper understanding of the application of projection matrices in solving linear systems.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of projection matrices in different vector spaces and their applications in more complex systems.
