## 📅 2024-12-08 — Session: Matrix Analysis and Gauss-Seidel Method Review

**🕒 15:05–15:15**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Matrix Analysis, Gauss-Seidel, Convergence, Linear Algebra  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to analyze the matrix A when \( \alpha = 0 \) and apply the Gauss-Seidel method to solve the equation \( Ax = b \), including verifying convergence conditions.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed the characteristic polynomial and eigenvalues of matrix A.
- Applied the Gauss-Seidel method and confirmed convergence due to diagonal dominance.
- Discussed the implications of strict diagonal dominance and its effect on convergence.
- Computed the iteration matrix for the Gauss-Seidel method, including matrix decomposition and spectral radius calculation.
- Handled errors during computation and retried the process to ensure accurate results.
- Recomputed the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix and its characteristics due to prior issues.
- Summarized the computation process, detailing matrix splitting, iteration matrix computation, and convergence analysis.

### Achievements
- Successfully analyzed matrix A and applied the Gauss-Seidel method.
- Identified convergence conditions and recomputed necessary matrices for accuracy.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of the computation process may be needed to ensure clarity and accuracy in manual calculations.
