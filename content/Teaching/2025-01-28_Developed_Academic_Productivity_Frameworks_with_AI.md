### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and document frameworks for enhancing academic [[productivity]] through [[AI]]-driven workflows.

### Key Activities
- **Content Outline to Textbook Creation Workflow**: Developed a structured [[workflow]] for transforming content outlines into textbooks using RAG agents and n8n [[automation]].
- **Mind Map of Prompting Techniques for LLMs**: Created a comprehensive mind map categorizing various prompting techniques for LLMs.
- **Academic Productivity Processes with [[AI]]**: Outlined a framework integrating [[AI]] roles and human interventions for academic [[productivity]].
- **Modular Process Design for Academic Productivity**: Designed modular workflows for book creation, paper screening, and drafting.
- **Integrating Structured Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Integrated SCoT prompting into [[AI]] workflows for enhanced academic [[productivity]].
- **[[AI]]-Driven Workflows in Academia Using n8n**: Explored the use of n8n for automating [[AI]]-driven workflows in academia.

### Achievements
- Developed multiple frameworks and workflows for academic [[productivity]].
- Integrated advanced prompting techniques and [[AI]] roles into academic processes.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the developed workflows in real academic scenarios.
- Conduct testing and refinement of the workflows for efficiency and effectiveness.
