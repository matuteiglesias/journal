**🕒 16:50–17:30**  
**🏷️ Labels**: automation, bibliography, Machine Learning, Databases, curriculum  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to automate the generation of a course bibliography and structure [[Machine Learning]] and Database courses using [[AI]] and markdown formats.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[workflow]] to automate course bibliography generation by looping over a [[CSV]] of topics, using [[AI]] to create summaries, and outputting results in markdown.
- Planned and structured a [[Machine Learning]] course covering fundamental to advanced topics, including MLOps, in 10 sessions.
- Created a markdown table template for [[Machine Learning]] classes, detailing key topics and related phrases.
- Provided an overview of foundational [[Machine Learning]] concepts, including classification, regression, unsupervised learning, and neural networks.
- Proposed and redesigned a curriculum for Database and [[Pandas]] courses, integrating data formats, SQL, [[optimization]], and [[automation]].

### Achievements
- Successfully outlined an automated process for bibliography generation.
- Structured comprehensive curricula for [[Machine Learning]] and Database courses.

### Pending Tasks
- Integrate the markdown templates into the course pipeline for seamless [[automation]].
- Finalize the curriculum details and prepare for implementation.
