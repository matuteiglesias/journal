**🕒 04:00–05:00**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Dimensionality, Thesis, Supervision, Autoencoder, PCA, Feature Selection  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to enhance the understanding of dimensionality in socioeconomic datasets, explore feature selection techniques, and develop a structured thesis supervision plan.

### Key Activities
- Explored complexities in defining dimensionality in datasets with mixed variable types, focusing on categorical contributions and advanced dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Discussed encoded representations in autoencoders and the need for higher dimensionality in input features.
- Calculated and analyzed the estimated dimensionality for each variable type (binary, categorical, continuous).
- Developed a thesis plan comparing feature selection techniques (Random Forest, PCA, Autoencoders) for income prediction.
- Planned the integration of time and spatial data into a thesis model to enhance predictions.
- Evaluated the need for Fourier features in time series analysis and analyzed frequency spectrum in autoencoder embeddings.
- Outlined a structured supervision plan for thesis development, focusing on data quality, modeling, and iterative feature selection.

### Achievements
- Gained insights into dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques.
- Developed a comprehensive thesis supervision plan with clear objectives and deliverables.

### Pending Tasks
- Further empirical testing of feature selection techniques.
- Implementation of the thesis supervision plan with students.
