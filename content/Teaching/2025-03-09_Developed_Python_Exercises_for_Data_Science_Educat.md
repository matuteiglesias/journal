### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and organize a comprehensive set of [[Python]] exercises for educational purposes, focusing on foundational skills relevant to data science.

### Key Activities
- Curated a list of [[Python]] exercises designed to teach foundational [[Python]] skills relevant to data science, categorized by programming concepts.
- Compiled a comprehensive collection of [[Python]] exercises with one-liner solutions to encapsulate core programming concepts and logic.
- Developed an exercise for Exploratory [[Data Analysis]] (EDA) using a sample dataset, guiding students from initial understanding to data cleaning and visualization.
- Summarized practical exercises for data modeling using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), addressing constraints in relationships among various entities.
- Described an educational activity to introduce data manipulation in [[Python]] before using SQL databases, including filtering and restructuring tasks.
- Reflected on key lessons in data analysis teaching, proposing improvements using [[Pandas]] and SQL.
- Proposed a teaching strategy that introduces students to limitations first, then optimizes with appropriate tools like [[Pandas]] and SQL.
- Addressed a SQL query error in [[Python]], explaining corrections using `pandasql` and `DuckDB` libraries.

### Achievements
- Successfully curated and structured a diverse set of [[Python]] exercises and educational strategies for data science.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement the proposed teaching strategies in actual classroom settings.
- Further refine and test the exercises with real student feedback.
