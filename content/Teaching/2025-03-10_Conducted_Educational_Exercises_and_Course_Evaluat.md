## 📅 2025-03-10 — Session: Conducted Educational Exercises and Course Evaluations

**🕒 13:20–13:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Matplotlib, Python, Data Science, Education, Course Evaluation  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to execute practical exercises in data science education and evaluate course content for improvements.

### Key Activities
1. **Scientific Figure Creation with [[Matplotlib]]**: Conducted an exercise to teach students how to create publication-quality scientific figures using [[Matplotlib]] and the law of Zipf.
2. **Exploratory [[Data Analysis]] (EDA) Report**: Guided students through selecting an open dataset, documenting it, and performing an EDA using [[Python]] and Markdown, culminating in exporting the report to PDF and [[HTML]].
3. **Data Narrative Exercise**: Focused on storytelling with data, where participants chose a relevant topic and developed a presentation combining data analysis and storytelling.
4. **Course Evaluation in [[Data Science]]**: Analyzed the structure and content of a data science course, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
5. **Probability and Statistics for [[Machine Learning]] Evaluation**: Reviewed a teaching segment on Probability and Statistics, including simulations and practical exercises, with suggestions for enhancement.

### Achievements
- Successfully executed educational exercises that enhance students' practical skills in data science and visualization.
- Provided detailed evaluations of course content, offering insights into potential improvements.

### Pending Tasks
- Implement suggested improvements in the evaluated courses for future iterations.
