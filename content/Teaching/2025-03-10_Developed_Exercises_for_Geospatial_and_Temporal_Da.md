### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and structure exercises for teaching [[data analysis]] using [[Pandas]], focusing on geospatial and temporal data.

### Key Activities
- Created structured exercises for geospatial data cleaning and visualization using GeoPandas and Folium, targeting a dataset of WiFi access points in Argentina.
- Developed exercises for temporal data manipulation and visualization using [[Pandas]], [[Matplotlib]], and Seaborn, utilizing real datasets like recipes and survey data.
- Updated exercises on vectorized operations and text manipulation in [[Pandas]], focusing on datasets like recipes and diamonds.
- Designed exploratory [[data analysis]] exercises using [[Pandas]] for datasets related to transportation and biodiesel prices in Argentina.

### Achievements
- Successfully structured multiple exercises covering a wide range of [[data analysis]] techniques in [[Pandas]].
- Enhanced the educational material by incorporating real-world datasets and advanced data manipulation techniques.

### Pending Tasks
- Review and test the exercises with students to ensure clarity and effectiveness.
- Gather feedback for further refinement and improvement of the exercises.
