### Session Goal
The session aimed to develop and enhance a series of exercises for teaching [[Python]] and [[Pandas]] to beginners, focusing on both fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation skills.

### Key Activities
- **Structured [[Python]] Exercises:** Created a set of exercises for beginners to learn [[Python]], covering basic to executable programs.
- **Enhanced [[Python]] Fundamentals:** Developed exercises teaching [[Python]] fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, and string manipulation.
- **Geringoso Translator Exercise:** Designed an exercise to create a Geringoso translator in [[Python]], introducing functions and classes.
- **Exercise Evaluation:** Improved existing [[Python]] exercises, focusing on arithmetic operations and simulations for advanced learners.
- **Progressive Exercise Strategy:** Planned a coherent [[strategy]] for progressive [[Python]] exercises, teaching functions, classes, and executable scripts.
- **Common [[Python]] Errors:** Compiled a guide and workshop on common beginner errors in [[Python]], providing solutions and examples.
- **[[Debugging]] Exercise:** Created a dynamic [[debugging]] exercise for identifying and correcting common code errors.
- **[[Pandas]] Exercises:** Proposed a new structure for teaching [[Pandas]] with clear objectives and tasks, including exercises on data I/O and manipulation.

### Achievements
- Developed a comprehensive set of exercises for [[Python]] and [[Pandas]], facilitating a structured learning path for beginners.
- Addressed common beginner errors in [[Python]] with practical solutions.

### Pending Tasks
- Further refinement of exercises based on student feedback.
- [[Integration]] of exercises into a broader curriculum for continuous learning.
