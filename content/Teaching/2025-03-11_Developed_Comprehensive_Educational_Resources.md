### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to develop comprehensive educational resources and exercises for programming and data science education, with a focus on [[Python]] and PostgreSQL.

### Key Activities
- **Created a Rich Educational Resource:** Proposed a complete educational resource that includes exercises, teaching annotations, and thematic connections to aid educators.
- **Simulated Expert Meeting:** Discussed the creation of an enriched dataset for programming exercises, defining key fields to maximize utility for educators.
- **Standardized Exercises:** Presented standardized exercises for data manipulation and visualization using [[Pandas]] and Plotnine.
- **Introduced Plotnine:** Provided an introduction to Plotnine, a [[Python]] implementation of ggplot2, for creating declarative visualizations.
- **Data Cleaning and EDA:** Detailed the process of cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using [[Pandas]] on a university transportation survey dataset.
- **PostgreSQL Exercises:** Developed exercises for creating and managing databases in PostgreSQL, including basic SQL commands and advanced topics.
- **Explored GUI Tools:** Explored graphical interface tools for SQL in PostgreSQL, such as pgAdmin and DBeaver, and provided a quick guide for using DBeaver.

### Achievements
- Developed a framework for educational resources that integrates programming exercises and data science concepts.
- Established a foundation for using GUI tools in database management education.

### Pending Tasks
- Further development of advanced PostgreSQL teaching materials.
- Exploration of additional GUI tools for database management.
