**üïí 06:00‚Äì06:10**  
**üè∑Ô∏è Labels**: Data Science, Python, Exercises, String Manipulation, Audio Testing  
**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to explore various programming exercises and concepts within [[Data Science]] and [[Python]] programming.

### Key Activities
- Discussed the importance of efficiency in searching elements within lists and suggested using data structures like sets for faster search in large datasets.
- Explored a [[Python]] function `mas_larga` to compare the lengths of two lists, useful for handling different datasets in [[Data Science]].
- Demonstrated string manipulation in [[Python]] through the `mezclar` function, which interleaves characters of two strings.
- Provided a practical coding solution for interleaving two strings character by character.
- Suggested testing functionality with audio content as a hands-on approach to evaluate functionality.
- Illustrated an audio transcription example of mixing names using a function call.
- Explained the interleaving of strings using a function with examples.
- Conducted a financial simulation exercise to teach basic financial concepts through mortgage payment simulations.
- Introduced a 'geringoso' translator exercise to practice string manipulation and dictionary usage in [[Python]].
- Discussed preparatory exercises for class that combine key concepts and skills.

### Achievements
- Successfully explored and documented multiple exercises and programming concepts in [[Data Science]] and [[Python]].

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing and refinement of the exercises and examples provided during the session.
