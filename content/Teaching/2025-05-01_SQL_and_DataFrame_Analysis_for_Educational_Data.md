### Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to analyze educational data using SQL queries and DataFrames in [[Python]], focusing on the aggregation of educational institutions and their populations by province and department.

### Key Activities
- Identified and resolved a `ValueError` in the DataFrame `ee_df_clean_sim` due to column length discrepancies.
- Developed SQL queries to aggregate educational data, focusing on the number of institutions and populations.
- Corrected SQL syntax errors using `pandasql` and ensured clean execution of queries.
- Addressed column ambiguity errors in SQL joins by using unique aliases.
- Created a generic wrapper function for graphing in [[Python]] using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Constructed and analyzed various DataFrames, including `ee_vs_pop_df`, to visualize educational data.

### Achievements
- Successfully executed SQL queries to merge and analyze educational data by department.
- Developed functions to generate educational data visualizations using Seaborn.
- Constructed and cleaned DataFrames for further analysis and visualization.

### Pending Tasks
- Confirm reconstruction of the DataFrame `bp_df_clean` or await new data loading.

### Session Context
This session involved extensive data analysis using SQL and [[Python]], focusing on educational data aggregation and visualization. The session was productive, resolving key errors and enhancing data visualization capabilities.
