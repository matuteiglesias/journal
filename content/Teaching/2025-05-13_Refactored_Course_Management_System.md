**🕒 17:05–17:45**  
**🏷️ Labels**: Python, Javascript, Flask, Course Management, Frontend Development, Web Development  
**📂 Project**: Teaching  
**⭐ Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The goal of this session was to enhance the course management system by refactoring functions for course ID management, comparing legacy and new code for exercise fetching, implementing dynamic rendering, and improving [[Flask]] routing and logging.

### Key Activities
- Implemented [[Python]] functions for retrieving filenames and exercise IDs based on a canonical course ID, emphasizing modularity and scalability.
- Compared legacy and new JavaScript code for fetching exercises, identifying compatibility issues and proposing a hybrid solution.
- Developed a hybrid approach for rendering exercise tables, combining legacy fixed tables with dynamic generation based on [[CSV]] data.
- Designed a dynamic frontend logic using JavaScript and `index.csv` for flexible course content management.
- Revised HTML structure for dynamic rendering of exercise sections, enhancing modularity.
- Updated [[Flask]] route to accommodate new URL patterns and improve error handling.
- Debugged a 404 error in a [[Flask]] application by checking file paths and route conflicts.
- Configured logging in [[Flask]] for better development visibility.
- Proposed a new CSS layout to improve webpage readability and visual structure.

### Achievements
- Successfully refactored course management functions and improved the frontend and backend integration.
- Established a more scalable and flexible system for course content management.

### Pending Tasks
- Further testing of the new implementations to ensure compatibility across all modules.
- Additional CSS enhancements for mobile responsiveness.
