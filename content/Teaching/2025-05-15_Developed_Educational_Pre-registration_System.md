**üìÇ Project**: Teaching  
**‚≠ê Priority**: MEDIUM  


### Session Goal
The session aimed to design and implement a comprehensive educational pre-registration system, focusing on automation, data processing, and database management.

### Key Activities
- **Exploration of Physics Concepts**: Discussed the definition of left and right in physics and philosophy, using weak interaction as a universal distinction.
- **[[Automation]] Planning**: Modeled pre-registration and automatic assignment systems, including a simplified MVP design for activity assignment using [[Python]] and pandas.
- **[[Data Management]]**: Created metadata schemas and relational database structures for educational datasets, and proposed denormalization strategies for activity management.
- **Onboarding Design**: Developed a modular onboarding system for educational projects, ensuring quality and reusability.
- **ETL [[Pipeline]] [[Development]]**: Designed an ETL pipeline to transform Google Sheets data into normalized [[CSV]] tables.
- **Error Resolution**: Addressed date format errors in pandas and improved data extraction functions using regex.
- **Database Modeling**: Created DBML diagrams for a pre-registration system in Third Normal Form.

### Achievements
- Designed a robust framework for educational pre-registration and activity assignment.
- Implemented metadata and database structures to support data integrity and ease of access.
- Developed an ETL pipeline to streamline data processing from Google Sheets.

### Pending Tasks
- Further enhancements to the `extract_preferencias()` function to handle more complex data scenarios.
