### Session Goal
The session focused on developing and structuring exercises related to data modeling and SQL within academic settings. The aim was to create educational content that enhances understanding of database design, data quality, and data processing.

### Key Activities
- Developed a banking system modeling exercise, including an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for educational purposes.
- Structured a banking model with steps for ERD development, relational mapping, and normalization.
- Proposed true/false questions for machine learning model evaluation, focusing on metrics like F1 score.
- Designed an exam on decision tree regression models, emphasizing learning concepts of generalization and model complexity.
- Analyzed an academic management system using ERD and normalization.
- Created SQL pipeline exercises for teaching concepts of data aggregation and normalization.
- Explored modular aggregation patterns in data science, emphasizing ETL processes.
- Proposed exercises for data quality assessment using pandas, focusing on aspects like completeness and consistency.

### Achievements
- Developed comprehensive educational exercises and exams covering data modeling, SQL pipelines, and data quality.
- Enhanced the understanding of database normalization and data processing through practical exercises.

### Pending Tasks
- Finalize the structured course curriculum and resources for a four-month programming and data analysis course.
- Complete the creation of a canonical document and editable table for course coordination.
