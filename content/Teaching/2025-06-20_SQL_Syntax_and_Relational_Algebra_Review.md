### Session Goal
The session aimed to review and provide feedback on SQL syntax understanding, clarify relational algebra concepts, and compare SQL with pandas for data manipulation.

### Key Activities
- Provided feedback on a student's SQL syntax understanding, suggesting improvements and a more concise pedagogical approach.
- Summarized basic SQL syntax, focusing on table creation, alias usage, and correct column enumeration in SELECT queries.
- Discussed the use of aliases in simple SQL queries and provided correct SQL code examples.
- Diagnosed common SQL query errors, specifically in clauses and aggregate functions, and provided corrected examples.
- Clarified the distinction between relational algebra's `PROJECT` operator and SQL's `SELECT DISTINCT`.
- Explained the use of the `AVG()` function in SQL and noted that `MEAN()` is not a standard SQL function.
- Identified common SQL syntax errors and provided corrections and examples.
- Explained the use of `GROUP BY` and `DISTINCT` in SQL, with examples and recommendations for students.

### Achievements
- Enhanced understanding of SQL syntax and relational algebra concepts.
- Provided actionable feedback and corrections for common SQL errors.
- Improved pedagogical approach for teaching SQL.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of SQL and pandas data manipulation comparisons.
- Additional practice exercises for students on SQL syntax and relational algebra.
