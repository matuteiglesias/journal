### Session Goal
The primary aim of this session was to explore decision tree regression models with varying depths and to analyze the bias-variance tradeoff using synthetic datasets.

### Key Activities
- Developed a [[Python]] notebook cell to visualize decision tree regression models with varying maximum depths (2, 3, and 5) on noisy sine data.
- Outlined a framework for analyzing the bias-variance tradeoff, including code examples for implementation and visualization.
- Provided a detailed explanation of the bias-variance decomposition, including mathematical formulation and [[Python]] function to compute bias and variance.

### Achievements
- Successfully visualized decision tree regression models with different depths.
- Established a systematic approach to analyze bias-variance tradeoff.
- Explained bias-variance decomposition with practical [[Python]] implementation.

### Pending Tasks
- Further exploration of other regression models for bias-variance analysis.
- Validation of results with additional datasets.
